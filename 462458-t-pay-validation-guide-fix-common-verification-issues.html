However, one must register by visiting the nearest TSC county office with their identification documents to use the platform. Unfortunately, the system has faced major security challenges where fraudsters utilise details of legit users to gain access. That is why the commission set up T-Pay validation to protect teachers' data. So, how does it work, and how do you fix common verification issues?</strong></p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/netstorage-tuko.akamaized.net/images/0fgjhs3dpbkun6smhg.jpg><p class=align-left>The Teachers Service Commission is one of the biggest employers in <a href=# rel=noopener>Kenya</a>. Considering the massive number of employees, the commission likely has a human resource nightmare regarding remuneration. Fortunately, they created the T-Pay portal to allow teachers to access their payslips online. However, the system hasn't been short of hiccups.</p><p class=align-left>So, any registered user that wants to check payslip online must complete updating their account details. This is an added security layer, but how does it work?</p><a class=c-article-read-also__image-wrapper href=#><img sizes=256px style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/netstorage-tuko.akamaized.net/images/21b2a4a4d4d7d38c.png></a><a class=c-article-read-also__headline href=# readability=27><p class=c-article-read-also__caption>Read also</p><p class=c-article-read-also__headline-wrapper><span class=c-article-read-also__headline-hover-inner>How to register an Airtel SIM card by yourself (online and USSD)</span></p></a><h2>What is T-Pay validation?</h2><p class=align-left>Most online accounts, including your email address, offer you an extra layer of <a href=#>security</a> to prevent your information from being accessed by unauthorised persons. That is what T-Pay validation is all about.</p><p class=align-left><strong>PAY ATTENTION</strong>: Follow us on <a href=# title="Instagram - Tuko" rel="nofollow noopener">Instagram</a> - get the most important news directly in your favourite app!</p><p class=align-left>The move is meant to protect teachers’ information in line with the Data Protection Act 2019. The added layer of security requires one to provide more information to secure their account, including their passport photo and <a href=#>registered mobile number</a>.</p><p class=align-left>When completing this process, anyone accessing the platform must provide an OTP (one-time-password) on top of their login details (username and password). Then, the code is sent to the registered phone number or email to allow a user to log in.</p><p class=align-left><a href=#>TSC</a> established this system as a countermeasure to fraud. This now means that even teachers' details are secure, and it would be easy to verify their identities.</p><a class=c-article-read-also__image-wrapper href=#><img sizes=256px style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/netstorage-tuko.akamaized.net/images/15704375cd8b925f.png></a><a class=c-article-read-also__headline href=# readability=29><p class=c-article-read-also__caption>Read also</p><p class=c-article-read-also__headline-wrapper><span class=c-article-read-also__headline-hover-inner>Bolt Food courier registration: requirements, salary, contacts</span></p></a><h2>What are the requirements for validation?</h2><p class=align-left>All registered users must upload crucial documents and provide specific information on the T-Pay portal to protect their data. These include:</p><ul><li>A passport-size photo: The photo should be clear. Your face shouldn't be covered with anything, including spectacles, headgear, or turbans.</li><li>Active phone number: The phone number you provide will be crucial in future as it will be utilised in your loan applications and processing. The TSC will also use the number for any official communication.</li><li>Valid email address: You must provide a valid email address by the Teachers Service Commission, taking the format james@mwalimu.tsc.go.ke.</li></ul><p class=align-left>Teachers were given 30 days to update their information on the portal (from June 9 to July 15, 2022). And heads of institutions are also <a href=# rel="nofollow noopener">required to validate</a> details of teachers under their supervision within the stipulated time.</p><h2>T-Pay validation guide</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/netstorage-tuko.akamaized.net/images/21b2a4a4d4d7d38c.png><p class=align-left>The TSC TPay verification process is quite straightforward, and the <a href=#>Teachers Service Commission</a> requires teachers to update their details in the following manner:</p><a class=c-article-read-also__image-wrapper href=#><img sizes=256px style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/netstorage-tuko.akamaized.net/images/f53c9e56f728d86e.jpg></a><a class=c-article-read-also__headline href=# readability=27><p class=c-article-read-also__caption>Read also</p><p class=c-article-read-also__headline-wrapper><span class=c-article-read-also__headline-hover-inner>Truepeoplesearch opt out and information removal guide</span></p></a><ul><li>Using your phone or computer’s browser, open the official TSC T-Pay portal.</li><li>You will be asked to enter your user name and password.

The photo must clearly show your face.</li><li>Enter and verify your current mobile phone number registered under your name.</li><li>Once you proceed, the system will send an OTP to your <a href=#>mobile number</a> to validate it.</li><li>Enter the OTP to validate the mobile number.</li><li>Once done, click on the validate button to prove that it is your mobile number. It is important to note that the system will only accept a valid code. Remember that you cannot change the number once it has been validated.

So, what are the common problems, and how can they be solved?</p><h3>Validation code mismatch</h3><p class=align-left>A validation code mismatch is a common problem, and it happens because you have skipped one of the most important parts of uploading a passport photo. Therefore, you need to start by uploading the passport photo according to the requirements and proceed to validate your number.</p><a class=c-article-read-also__image-wrapper href=#><img sizes=256px style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/netstorage-tuko.akamaized.net/images/f107fe1f290d586c.png></a><a class=c-article-read-also__headline href=# readability=29><p class=c-article-read-also__caption>Read also</p><p class=c-article-read-also__headline-wrapper><span class=c-article-read-also__headline-hover-inner>How to create an account, alter the password, log in to TTUC student portal</span></p></a><h3>Uploading passport size less than 5MB</h3><p class=align-left>If you get an error that you must upload a passport photo less than 5MB, your file is too large for the system to handle. The portal only handles files less than 5MB, so it would be better to compress your photo or take another one that fits the required file size.</p><h3>Lacking a TSC email</h3><p class=align-left>Only a few teachers created their TSC emails, which means that some will face an issue verifying their email because it is non-existent. However, you can create one easily by using the official <a href=# rel="nofollow noopener">Microsoft Office link</a>. You must use your first name, surname, and the last two digits of your TSC number.</p><h3>Where to access the OTP email</h3><p class=align-left>If you don’t know where to access your TSC email, it would be hard for you to verify your email address. To access it, visit <a href=# rel="nofollow noopener">office.com</a> and log in using your credentials.</p><a class=c-article-read-also__image-wrapper href=#><img sizes=256px style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/netstorage-tuko.akamaized.net/images/bfed9e883aab0e8f.png></a><a class=c-article-read-also__headline href=# readability=27><p class=c-article-read-also__caption>Read also</p><p class=c-article-read-also__headline-wrapper><span class=c-article-read-also__headline-hover-inner>What is billing address in online shopping?</span></p></a><h3>You have not received an OTP email</h3><p class=align-left>If you have tried everything else and are still not receiving a verification code in your registered email, you can ask the commission's officials for help. Send an email to tpayverification@tsc.go.ke detailing your issue. Ensure that you attach a scanned copy of your original identification document.</p><p class=align-left>T-Pay validation is a great step by the Teachers Service Commission to protect teachers' data.
