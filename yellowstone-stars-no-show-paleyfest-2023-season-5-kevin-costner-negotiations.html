According to that report, none of those performers or executives were actually in attendance when the panel began, despite the fact that they were still listed among the attendees on the website right up until the event started.</p><p>Instead, actors Mo Brings Plenty (Mo), Dawn Olivieri (Sarah Atwood), Josh Lucas (young John Dutton) and Wendy Moniz (Lynelle Perry) were on hand for a conversation about the show, joined by Keith Cox, President of Scripted at MTV Entertainment Studios.</p><p><a href=#>USA Today</a> reports that there were audible groans and even boos from the audience when a rep for PaleyFest announced the changes, attributing them to "scheduling conflicts," and some audience members walked out of the event and later turned to social media to express anger and disappointment. According to Deadline, the actors who did participate draw a warm reception from the remaining audience.</p><p>The PaleyFest no-shows happened during a time when backstage drama between Costner and the producers of Yellowstone has been making headlines. According to multiple reports, the Oscar winner has been unable to come to an agreement over scheduling for the second half of the season due to a conflict with another project of his called <a href=#>Horizon</a>, and they're <a href=#>considering killing off his character and ending the show</a> at the conclusion of Season 5. According to those reports, the network will move on to a new show in the Yellowstone franchise starring Matthew McConaughey.</p><p>Most recently, a Paramount executive <a href=#>confirmed</a> that a new Yellowstone spinoff starring McConaughey will move forward, whether Costner returns to Yellowstone or not.</p><p>The actors on hand at PaleyFest confirmed they have not begun filming the second half of Season 5 of Yellowstone yet. In regard to Costner, Cox told the audience that “we are very confident he will continue with the show," causing the fans on hand to erupt into cheers.</p><p>Cox also said more news about Season5 is coming "soon" and that the second half of the season “will be phenomenal. I am confident.”</p><p>As part of Taste of Country's comprehensive coverage of all things Yellowstone, check out our Dutton Rules podcast on <a href=#>Apple Podcasts</a> and <a href=#>Spotify</a>.</p><h2 class=photogallery-title>PICS: See Inside the Historic Texas Ranch Where the New 'Yellowstone: 6666' Spinoff Is Filmed</h2><p>The massive, historic Texas ranch where the new Yellowstone spinoff Yellowstone: 6666 is filming has sold for just under $200 million, and pictures show a property that is truly part of Texas history.</p><p>The 6666 Ranch&nbsp;— better-known as the Four Sixes Ranch&nbsp;— in Guthrie, Texas, dates back to 1870.
