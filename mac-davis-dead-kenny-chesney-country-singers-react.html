"I was blessed to have it shine on me.⁣"</p><p><a href=#>Travis Tritt</a>, <a href=#>Lee Greenwood</a> and TG Sheppard also shared their heartbreak over Davis' deatah on social media.&nbsp;<a href=#>Jake Owen</a> points out how&nbsp;Davis' talent truly spanned generations, noting that&nbsp;the singer and actor&nbsp;— 78 years old when he died — had written for Presley and Avicii during his dynamic career.</p><p>"More importantly, he was a great husband and a father," <a href=#>Owen says</a>. "My thoughts and prayers go out to his family."</p><p>Both the CMA and ACM Awards noted Davis' unexpected death, with the latter sharing video of his Entertainer of the Year win, given in 1975.</p><p>Davis' surprise in winning the honor was sincere, as at that time he'd not had a hit on country radio, but he'd had several crossover hits and his own television show (The Mac Davis Show on NBC) by that point. "In the Ghetto" and "A Little Less Conversation" were already hits for Presley by 1974, but his song "Baby Don't Get Hooked&nbsp;on Me" was relatively new. It'd become a No. 1 Billboard Hot 100 hit, but stopped just inside the Top 30 on the Hot Country Songs chart.&nbsp;Davis' first country Top 10 wouldn't come until 1980.</p><p>Per Davis' manager, his death came following complications after heart surgery in Nashville earlier in the week. He leaves behind his wife of 38 years, Lise, and three sons, Scott, Noah and Cody, as well as grandchildren.</p><p><h2 class=photogallery-title>Country Stars Remember Mac Davis</h2></p><p><h2 class=photogallery-title>Country Stars Who've Died In 2020</h2></p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmiskajBprvFnKaupqSnxm%2BvzqZmppmTYrGiwsisZJ2dkZl6rLHNp7Bmm5iawK%2Bx2GaaqK2eqb%2B6edKipaCdoqh6s7HAnKto</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./isaiah-roby-parents-girlfriend-salary-html.html><span>←</span><span>Isaiah Roby Parents, Family, Girlfriend, Salary</span></a>
