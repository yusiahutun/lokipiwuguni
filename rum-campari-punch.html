If you are like me, you probably just assumed that rum punch = fruit juice + rum. You may have not have known that Bajan (Barbadian) Rum Punch and Planter’s Punch, the two best-known rum punches, date back over a century, and even have their own rhyme [“One of Sour, Two of Sweet, Three of Strong, Four of Weak.”], I like to imagine so that no matter how many you’ve had, you won’t forget how to make more. However, how you define these elements needs only to be limited by your imagination. While the “sour” element is usually lime juice, it may also be lemon or another citrus juice, and I imagine that both pomegranate and cranberry juices would mix in well. The “sweet” part is usually simple syrup, a 1:1 mixture of sugar and water, heated until it dissolves and cooled. The strong should be good island rum, preferably dark, and the “weak” can be water or club soda, sometimes it’s ice and sometimes it’s more juice, like pineapple. (In my opinion, rum punch made with pineapple juice is always 200 percent better than those made without it.) Rum punch can either be mixed in a shaker with ice, a dash or two of Agnostura bitters and a pinch of nutmeg (though I’ve seen versions with everything from cayenne to grenadine and vermouth in them), or served in a big punch bowl, with a ladle.</p><p><a title="you can make dramatic ice with anything" href=#><img decoding=async src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/i0.wp.com/farm6.staticflickr.com/5507/11647760925_a2b8e59fee_z.jpg alt="you can make dramatic ice with anything" data-recalc-dims=1 style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center></a><br><a title="rum punch, with campari" href=#><img decoding=async src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/i0.wp.com/farm6.staticflickr.com/5550/11648130424_cdc6240c88_z.jpg alt="rum punch, with campari" data-recalc-dims=1 style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center></a></p><p>While I was bent on coming up with my own spin on rum punch for you, <a href=#>Tasting Table</a> rendered this completely unnecessary last week, sharing a recipe from Brad Farran, formerly of Brooklyn’s Clover Club and now head bartender at Garland in Raleigh, NC with the curious addition of the bitter, red and citrus-y aperatif known as <a href=#>Campari</a> (the primary ingredient in Negronis) and we just had to make it. This is not your ordinary rum punch, the intensity of the Campari is surprising at first but quickly becomes the best part of it and I can’t think of a better excuse to bring down the vintage punch bowl down from the top shelf in your parent’s house (as I did last night, though sadly after I’d already taken these photos). I think punch is overdue for a comeback: it’s pretty, it doesn’t demand that every single ingredient is top shelf, it’s forgiving of any adjustments you need to make and it serves a crowd. And, if you want to get a head start and make it today, you’ll find that it gets (admirably) even mellower and more harmonious with age, even if you (understandably) do not intend to.</p><p><a title=ladled href=#><img decoding=async src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/i0.wp.com/farm8.staticflickr.com/7307/11648020793_4cbf047db7_z.jpg alt=ladled data-recalc-dims=1 style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center></a><br><a title="stashed away for the party" href=#><img decoding=async src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/i0.wp.com/farm3.staticflickr.com/2884/11648022263_052b12dcc4_z.jpg alt="stashed away for the party" data-recalc-dims=1 style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center></a></p><p><b>One year ago:</b> <a href=#>Fromage Fort</a><br><b>Two years ago:</b> <a href=#>Scallion Meatballs with Soy-Ginger Glaze</a><br><b>Three years ago:</b> <a href=#>Milk Punch</a><br><b>Four years ago:</b> <a href=#>Creamed Mushrooms on Butter-Chive Toast</a>, <a href=#>How to Host Brunch (And Still Sleep In!)</a>, <a href=#>Spinach and Cheese Strata</a> (I’m making this on New Years Day again!), <a href=#>Parmesan Cream Crackers</a>, <a href=#>Walnut Pesto</a> and <a href=#>Spicy Caramel Popcorn</a><br><b>Five years ago:</b> <a href=#>Sugar-and-Spice Candied Nuts</a><br><b>Six years ago:</b> <a href=#>Caramel Cake</a><br><b>Seven years ago:</b> <a href=#>Coq au Vin</a></p><p><b>Rum Campari Punch</b><br>Adapted from <a href=#>Brendan McHale, Tasting Table Test Kitchen</a></p><p>Don’t fret if you don’t have a punch bowl. Any big bowl + soup ladle + small cups will do. Icing down the punch bowl or chilling it before you use it will help keep the drinks cooler longer. You can make a dramatic ice boulder for the center by freezing a Tupperware-like container full of water the night before (ever the New Yorkers, we used a take-out container; Brad Farran of Garland in Raleigh, NC smartly noted to TT that the lid will keep you from spilling water as you move it into the freezer, I should have listened). Finally, one of the best things about punch is that it ages well; a day or two later, the flavors are more mellow and harmonious. We made this over the weekend (FOR PRACTICE, okay?) and can’t wait to bring it to the New Years party, you know, all two hours that we are there before going home to put <a href=#>this little dude</a> to bed. Just put the fizzy stuff in when you’re ready to serve it so it doesn’t get flat.</p><p>The adjusted recipe below is a little sweeter than the original and uses slightly less rum, as 3 3/4 cups are called for but that would require that you had a full bottle plus 1/2 cup from another; it was plenty strong even with the missing rum. Cruzan Black Strap Rum was recommended, but we were unable to find it, a bummer as it is dark black in color and would have made this all the more stunning. [Updated to note: Based on some of your responses, Cruzan Black Strap Rum was not the dream many of us hoped it would be here — many found it to yield a dark/less pretty/murky color punch with a strong molasses flavor. So, if this sounds appealing, definitely seek out this rum; if not, just use a regular dark rum, as we did. Hope that helps.]</p><p>Yield: Just shy of 4 quarts; you can ladle 30 1/2-cup servings from it</p><p><u>Punch</u><br>1 1/4 cups sugar<br>1 1/4 cups cold water<br>1 1/4 cups lime juice<br>3 3/4 cups pineapple juice<br>1 3/4 cups Campari (or less, to taste)<br>1 750 ml (about 3 1/4 cups) bottle dark rum<br>1 750 ml (about 3 1/4 cups) bottle sparkling wine</p><p><u>Garnish</u><br>1 giant ice cube<br>1 orange, sliced thin<br>1 lime, sliced thin<br>or thick peels of zest from 1 lime and 1 orange</p><p>Heat the sugar with 1/4 cup cold water until it comes to a boil and sugar dissolves.
