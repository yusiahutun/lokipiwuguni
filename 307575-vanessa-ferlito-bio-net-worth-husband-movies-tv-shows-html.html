While a few of them prefer to live a publicized life decorated by their activities, lifestyles, wealth, families, among other things, Vanessa prefers a rather low profile. However, situations arise, and the ones who prefer staying under the radar are dragged to the limelight against the very public they tried to avoid. The American actress popular for her movie roles under the CSI: NY has recently surfaced in the headlines due to her supposed plastic surgery rumours. But how true are these allegations?

At the age of two, she lost her father due to drug overdose and was therefore brought up by her mother and a stepfather who owned a hair salon in New York. Life as a kid was rough for her. She was able to identify her passions and dreams at a young age, which she has grown to achieve.</p><a class=c-article-read-also__image-wrapper href=#><img sizes=256px style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/netstorage-tuko.akamaized.net/images/483729bba3922993.png></a><a class=c-article-read-also__headline href=# readability=27><p class=c-article-read-also__caption>Read also</p><p class=c-article-read-also__headline-wrapper><span class=c-article-read-also__headline-hover-inner>Beth Thomas’ bio: What happened to her and her siblings?</span></p></a><p class=align-left>At a tender age, she pursued a career in acting where she tried roles in different short films and was assigned unimportant tasks during her early days. To make ends meet, she became a New York club kid and later a Wilhelmina model. Given the high degree of privacy she opts to keep, there is no clear record of her school life. Rumours have it that while she was in elementary school, she was hated by the rest of the kids who thought she was different. In 2007 Vanessa gave birth to her son Vince, and in 2014, she was rumoured to be in a relationship with Quentin Tarantino, also an actor.</p><p class=align-left>Vanessa has appeared in numerous films and movies since her professional entry into the showbiz industry in 2001.

As of today, Vanessa's son, Vince, is aged 11 years and will be celebrating his 12th birthday come Septembers 2019.</p><p class=align-left>Until today, Vanessa has never revealed the father to her son. On several occasions and interviews, she distances herself from discussions relating to the husband or her son. However, she talks candidly about the kind of mother she is for his son both during childhood and as a young teenager.</p>I'm obsessed with my son. I take parenting to the fullest. I breastfed until he was 2.

The announcement came as a shock for many, especially from fans of the TV show. In one of the interviews with TV Guide, she cast down any possibility of her ever getting fired by the directors of the show. She cited that she had no intention of being part of an hour-long TV show. "I had no intention of doing an hour TV show. I had just wrapped the movie Man of the House with Tommy Lee Jones, so it's not like I had nothing going on."</p><p class=align-left>Despite being never keen on the idea of being part of a TV show, she still accepted the offer by the NY producers to be part of CS: New York. According to her, she thought it was a <a href=# rel="nofollow noopener">great opportunity at first</a>, but later she was no longer into the TV show idea. However, despite speculations that there was brushing shoulders with the directors and producers of the show, she said that being part of CSI: NY was a great experience. She still insists that she wants to do more movies as opposed to TV shows due to reasons only known to her.</p><a class=c-article-read-also__image-wrapper href=#><img sizes=256px style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/netstorage-tuko.akamaized.net/images/62126fac77d8ffb1.jpg></a><a class=c-article-read-also__headline href=# readability=31><p class=c-article-read-also__caption>Read also</p><p class=c-article-read-also__headline-wrapper><span class=c-article-read-also__headline-hover-inner>Nikki Perkins bio: Age, ethnicity, Jamie break-up, siblings, net worth</span></p></a><p class=align-left>It is the second time that Ferlito has left a TV show to do a movie instead. During her time as an actress in the series 24, she still left despite being urged by producers to stay a bit longer. Ferlito cumulatively did 12 episodes of the TV series. She went to take part in the movie Man in the House. According to Ferlito, leaving "CSI: NY" was creating a space and opportunity for herself. However, she still has great respect for the show producers and Anthony Zuiker to the extent that she would respond to any of their requests anytime.</p><h2>Ferlito's plastic surgery</h2><p class=align-left>Women are most insecure about their looks when they think some parts of their body affects the degree of their beauty. A few who are financially capable of financing a plastic surgery opt for one, but others live with their situation forever. For Ferlito, she had particular concerns about her lips and nose shape. Despite being a pretty woman, it was a situation she could only tolerate. In the year 2017, she was rumoured to have had lip augmentation and a rhinoplasty<a href=# rel="nofollow noopener"> to rectify her nos</a>e.</p><a class=c-article-read-also__image-wrapper href=#><img sizes=256px style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/netstorage-tuko.akamaized.net/images/663b1256b1354beb.jpg></a><a class=c-article-read-also__headline href=# readability=28><p class=c-article-read-also__caption>Read also</p><p class=c-article-read-also__headline-wrapper><span class=c-article-read-also__headline-hover-inner>Debbie Higgins McCall bio, family and cause of death</span></p></a><p class=align-left>That was indeed one hell of a rumour. The online community had her pictures before and after college all over social media in support of the allegation. However, she cited that the gossip brought her more attention and fame instead. The ab initio Vanessa would not even consider responding to such claims. Her reaction would be judged otherwise. But until she gives a response to these online rumours, we cannot conclude the surgery. Meanwhile, fans have responded to the difference in her new look with some referring to her rhinoplasty as an operation gone wrong as the new nose seems unnatural. Conversely, others have showered praises on her citing that the lip augmentation was indeed one of the best surgery procedures done to perfection.</p><h2>How much is Vanessa Ferlito net worth?</h2><p class=align-left>Vanessa's acting career dates back to the 90s and since then has featured in numerous TV shows and movies.
