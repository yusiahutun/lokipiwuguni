At first, this can seem a little daunting and confusing, but once you understand how it works, it's not so hard.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>In this article, we'll look at how to reference another sheet in the same Excel file and how to reference a different Excel file. We'll also cover things like how to reference a cell range in a function, how to make things simpler with defined names, and how to use VLOOKUP for dynamic references.</p><h2 id=how-to-reference-another-sheet-in-the-same-excel-file>How to Reference Another Sheet in the Same Excel File</h2><p>A basic cell reference is written as the column letter followed by the row number.</p><p>So the cell reference B3 refers to the cell at the intersection of column B and row 3.</p><p>When referring to cells on other sheets, this cell reference is preceded with the other sheet's name.&nbsp;For example, below is a reference to cell B3 on a sheet name "January."</p><pre>=January!B3</pre><p>The exclamation point (!) separates the sheet name from the cell address.</p><p>If the sheet name contains spaces, then you must enclose the name with single quotation marks in the reference.</p><pre>='January Sales'!B3</pre><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>To create these references, you can type them directly into the cell. However, it is easier and more reliable to let Excel write the reference for you.</p><p>Type an equal sign (=) into a cell, click on the Sheet tab, and then click the cell that you want to cross-reference.</p><p>As you do this, Excel writes the reference for you in the Formula Bar.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static1.howtogeekimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2019/07/sheet-reference-2.png><p>Press Enter to complete the formula.</p><h2 id=how-to-reference-another-excel-file>How to Reference Another Excel File</h2><p>You can refer to cells of another workbook using the same method. Just be sure that you have the other Excel file open before you begin typing the formula.</p><p>Type an equal sign (=), switch to the other file, and then click the cell in that file you want to reference. Press Enter when you're done.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>The completed cross-reference contains the other workbook name enclosed in square brackets, followed by the sheet name and cell number.</p><pre>=[Chicago.xlsx]January!B3</pre><p>If the file or sheet name contains spaces, then you'll need to enclose the file reference (including the square brackets) in single quotation marks.</p><pre>='[New York.xlsx]January'!B3</pre><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static1.howtogeekimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2019/07/workbook-reference.png><p>In this example, you can see dollar signs ($) amongst the cell address. This is an absolute cell reference (<a href=#>Find out more about absolute cell references</a>).</p><p>When referencing cells and ranges on different Excel files, the references are made absolute by default. You can change this to a relative reference if required.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>If you look at the formula when the referenced workbook is closed, it will contain the entire path to that file.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static1.howtogeekimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2019/07/closed-workbook.png><p>Although creating references to other workbooks is straightforward, they are more susceptible to issues. Users creating or renaming folders and moving files can break these references and cause errors.</p><p>Keeping data in one workbook, if possible, is more reliable.</p><h2 id=how-to-cross-reference-a-cell-range-in-a-function>How to Cross Reference a Cell Range in a Function</h2><p>Referencing a single cell is useful enough. But you might want to write a function (such as SUM) that references a range of cells on another worksheet or workbook.</p><p>Start the function as usual and then click on the sheet and the range of cells---the same way you did in the previous examples.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>In the following example, a SUM function is summing the values from range B2:B6 on a worksheet named Sales.</p><pre>=SUM(Sales!B2:B6)</pre><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static1.howtogeekimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2019/07/range-in-function.png><h2 id=how-to-use-defined-names-for-simple-cross-references>How to Use Defined Names for Simple Cross References</h2><p>In Excel, you can assign a name to a cell or range of cells. This is more meaningful than a cell or range address when you look back at them. If you use a lot of references in your spreadsheet, naming those references can make it much easier to see what you've done.</p><p>Even better, this name is unique for all the worksheets in that Excel file.</p><p>For example, we could name a cell 'ChicagoTotal' and then the cross-reference would read:</p><pre>=ChicagoTotal</pre><p>This is a more meaningful alternative to a standard reference like this:</p><pre>=Sales!B2</pre><p>It's easy to create a defined name. Start by selecting the cell or range of cells that you want to name.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Click in the Name Box in the top left corner, type the name you want to assign, and then press Enter.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static1.howtogeekimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2019/07/defined-name.png><p>When creating defined names, you cannot use spaces. Therefore, in this example, the words have been joined in the name and separated by a capital letter. You could also separate words with characters like a hyphen (-) or underscore (_).</p><p>Excel also has a Name Manager that makes monitoring these names in the future easy.&nbsp;Click Formulas > Name Manager.&nbsp;In the Name Manager window, you can see a list of all of the defined names in the workbook, where they are, and what values they currently store.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong> <img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static1.howtogeekimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2019/07/name-manager.png><p>You can then use the buttons along the top to edit and delete these defined names.</p><h2 id=how-to-format-data-as-a-table>How to Format Data as a Table</h2><p>When working with an extensive list of related data, using Excel's Format as Table feature can simplify the way that you reference data in it.</p><p>Take the following simple table.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static1.howtogeekimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2019/07/small-list.png><p>This could be formatted as a table.</p><p>Click on a cell in the list, switch to the "Home" tab, click the "Format as Table" button, and then select a style.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong> <img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static1.howtogeekimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2019/07/format-as-table.png><p>Confirm that the range of cells is correct and that your table has headers.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static1.howtogeekimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2019/07/confirm-range.png><p>You can then assign a meaningful name to your table from the "Design" tab.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static1.howtogeekimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2019/07/table-name.png><p>Then, if we needed to sum the sales of Chicago, we could refer to the table by its name (from any sheet), followed by a square bracket ([) to see a list of the table's columns.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong> <img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static1.howtogeekimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2019/07/structured-references.png><p>Select the column by double-clicking it in the list and enter a closing square bracket. The resulting formula would look something like this:</p><pre>=SUM(Sales[Chicago])</pre><p>You can see how tables can make referencing data for aggregation functions such as SUM and AVERAGE easier than standard sheet references.</p><p>This table is small for the purposes of demonstration. The larger the table and the more sheets you have in a workbook, the more benefits you'll see.</p><h2 id=how-to-use-the-vlookup-function-for-dynamic-references>How to Use the VLOOKUP Function for Dynamic References</h2><p>The references used in the examples thus far have all been fixed to a specific cell or range of cells.&nbsp;That's great and is often sufficient for your needs.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>However, what if the cell you are referencing has the potential to change when new rows are inserted, or somebody sorts the list?</p><p>In those scenarios, you could not guarantee the value you want will still be in the same cell that you initially referenced.</p><p>An alternative in these scenarios is to use a lookup function within Excel to search for the value in a list. This makes it more durable against changes to the sheet.</p><p>In the following example, we use the VLOOKUP function to look up an employee on another sheet by their employee ID and then return their start date.</p><p>Below is the example list of employees.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static1.howtogeekimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2019/07/employees.png><p>The VLOOKUP function looks down the first column of a table and then returns information from a specified column to the right.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>The following VLOOKUP function searches for the employee ID entered into cell A2 in the list shown above and returns the date joined from column 4 (fourth column of the table).</p><pre>=VLOOKUP(A2,Employees!A:E,4,FALSE)</pre><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static1.howtogeekimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2019/07/vlookup.png><p>Below is an illustration of how this formula searches the list and returns the correct information.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static1.howtogeekimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2019/07/found-1282.png><p>The great thing about this VLOOKUP over the previous examples is that the employee will be found even if the list changes in order.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p><strong>Note:&nbsp;</strong>VLOOKUP is an incredibly useful formula, and we've only scratched the surface of its value in this article.
