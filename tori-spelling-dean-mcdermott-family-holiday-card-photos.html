The aftermath of the cheating scandal and the pair's rocky relationship was documented on their reality show, <strong>"True Tori."</strong></p><p>While many wouldn't want to air their dirty laundry to the public, Tori says filming the show has been cathartic.</p><p>"I personally like doing it, for me it works," she told <strong>Today's Hoda Kotb</strong> and <strong>Kathie Lee</strong>. "I know it's individual, it's not for everyone. I came from a family that didn't talk about emotions, we repressed things. This was a vehicle for me to feel like a safe atmosphere where I could share and it's cathartic. It's therapy for me."</p><p><span>In fact, Dean recently admitted that he wants to quit the couple's reality show.</span></p><p><span>"I'm not going to continue with the show," Dean told<a href=#><strong> Access Hollywood Live</strong></a> last week. "We have five more shows left... I can't do this anymore. I can't keep opening a vein, opening my soul and sharing my feelings and thoughts and demons with the world."</span></p><p><span>He isn't happy with the way Tori -- and the show -- portrays him as a bad guy (go figure!). Check out the clip above to see him confront his wife about his negative public image.</span></p><p><span>Do you think Tori and Dean will make it -- or are they headed for a split?
