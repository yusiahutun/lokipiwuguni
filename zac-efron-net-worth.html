The Disney Channel alum became the 2,767th celeb to receive a star on the Hollywood Walk of Fame on December 20, located on 6426 Hollywood Blvd.</p><p>Born on October 18, 1987, in San Luis Obispo, California, his full name is Zachary David Alexander Efron and he rose to fame in the mid-2000s for his role as Troy Bolton in the Disney Channel film High School Musical and its sequels. Efron has continued to diversify his roles with films like Neighbors (2014), Dirty Grandpa (2016), and The Greatest Showman (2017), where he showcased his singing and dancing skills once again. He also starred in the critically acclaimed film Extremely Wicked, Shockingly Evil and Vile (2019), portraying the notorious serial killer Ted Bundy.</p><p>Related Stories</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/stylecaster.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/12/Zac-Efron-Face.jpg> <img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/stylecaster.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/03/Zac-Efron-Vanessa-Hudgens.png><p>In December 2023, he entered the A24 fam by portraying Kevin Von Erich in the critically acclaimed biopic The Iron Claw, based on the famous wrestling family the Von Erich brothers. On taking on the role, Efron told Entertainment Weekly that “The boys are all very still and quite stoic at times,” of <a rel=nofollow href=#>watching the Von Erichs on screen</a>. “But I think it’s a bit of a defense mechanism they built up. They put these walls up to the outside world in order to stay strong enough to persevere through everything they had to do. They had to be perfect all the time.”</p><p>The fact that Kevin is still alive made Efron consider his character in a more nuanced way, as well. “Playing somebody who’s real and still alive adds an extra layer of complexity, I think,” the High School Musical actor said during a<a href=# data-type=link data-id=https://stylecaster.com/lists/zac-efron-girlfriend/> Q&A of the movie</a>. “As an actor, it’s a fine line. You want to do everything you can to make sure it’s an honest portrayal of the character, without going so hard that it’s an impersonation. And for this movie, just knowing that he was going to be out there and would ultimately see it, I didn’t know if I was going to do a good job or not.”</p><p>Now, <a href=# id=auto-tag_zac-efron data-tag=zac-efron>Zac Efron</a>‘s net worth has certainly come in handy as far as that goes. Here’s how much the actor has to burn through, should he choose to really “quit” Hollywood altogether.</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading id=how-much-did-zac-efron-make-for-the-iron-claw>How much did Zac Efron make for The Iron Claw?</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/stylecaster.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/12/iron-claw-2.png><p>According to CastSalary.com, Efron reportedly took a salary of $ 2 million for The Iron Claw (though there’s no link to attribute this figure so take it with a grain of salt). The total budget of the film was $20.4 million.</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading id=how-much-did-zac-efron-make-for-high-school-musical>How much did Zac Efron make for High School Musical?</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/stylecaster.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/High-School-Musical-3.jpg><p>Chances are you learned about Zac Efron after he starred as teenage heartthrob Troy Bolton in Disney Channel’s&nbsp;High School Musical&nbsp;franchise. But the truth is, the films weren’t always expected to be a hit. Multiple sources suggest that Zac was only paid around $100,000 for the first movie. Once HSM became the most commercially successful Disney Channel Original Movie (!!!) however, things began to look up for the young star.</p><p>By&nbsp;High School Musical 3: Senior Year, Zac was making an estimated $3 million to $5 million. The major paycheck bump meant Zac was making the most out of anyone in his cast.</p><p>In an interview with E! News in 2022, Zac revealed he’d be open to playing his High School Musical character, Troy Bolton, again. “Of course, of course. I mean, to have an opportunity in any form to go back and work with that team would be so amazing. My heart is still there. That would be incredible. I hope it happens,” he said at the time. In 2016, <a href=# rel=noopener>Variety</a> reported Disney Channel had started casting on a High School Musical 4 movie, which planned to introduce a new cast of characters. “The potential movie is described as continuing the story of High School Musical, while introducing new East High Wildcats and their cross-town school rivals, the West High Knights,” Variety reported at the time.</p><p>Though conversations around High School Musical 4 slowed down, Disney Plus premiered a TV spinoff of the franchise, High School Musical: The Musical: The Series, in 2019. The show starred Olivia Rodrigo, Joshua Bassett and other actors as students at a fictional version of East High School as they performed school musicals, including a production of High School Musical. High School Musical actors Lucas Grabeel and Kaycee Stroh made cameos as themselves in the first season, while alum Corbin Bleu had a main role in season 3.</p><p>In September 2022, Disney confirmed that a fourth High School Musical movie, titled High School Musical 4: The Reunion, was in the works. “On their first day back, the principal announces that Disney has decided to make the long-awaited High School Musical 4: The Reunion movie on location at their beloved high school, and our Wildcats will be playing featured extras in the movie,” Disney’s description read. The announcement came after Zac posted an Instagram photo of him in front of East High School with the caption: “Don’t you…Forget about me.”</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading id=how-much-did-zac-efron-make-for-the-greatest-showman>How much did Zac Efron make for The Greatest Showman?</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/stylecaster.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/The-Greatest-Showman.jpg><p>While Zac Efron’s role in&nbsp;HSM&nbsp;definitely put his name on the map, the star has taken that career success and used it to grab a handful of other lucrative opportunities. Since the franchise wrapped, Zac has starred in plenty of other films from Doctor Seuss’&nbsp;The Lorax, Neighbors, Hairspray,&nbsp;17 Again, and yes, 2017’s The Greatest Showman.&nbsp;</p><p>While it’s unclear how much exactly Zac made from Showman, we know the film grossed a whopping $439 million worldwide—so we can expect his paycheck was easily in the millions, too. For comparison’s sake, Zac’s starring role in 2009’s&nbsp;17 Again&nbsp;earned him $1 million alone.</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading id=what-is-zac-efron-s-net-worth>What is Zac Efron’s net worth?</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/stylecaster.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/05/Zac-Efron-2.jpg><p>What is Zac Efron’s net worth? Zac Efron’s net worth is $25 million, according to <a href=# rel="noopener nofollow">Celebrity Net Worth</a>. Along with what he made from the High School Musical movies, The Greatest Showman and Down to Earth, Zac Efron’s net worth also includes his earnings from other blockbusters, such as 17 Again, Hairspray, Baywatch, Neighbors, The Lucky One and Dirty Grandpa. According to Celebrity Net Worth, Zac was paid $1 million to star as Matthew Perry’s younger self in 2009’s 17 Again. The site also reported that Zac was paid $100,000 for star as Link Larkin in 2007’s Hairspray, which was one of his first mainstream movie roles after High School Musical.</p><p>In an interview with <a href=# rel=noopener>The Hollywood Reporter</a> in 2016, Zac looked back on his success as a child star and how it affected him, for better and for worse. “No matter who you are, you face challenges growing up,” he said. “You go with your things, you learn, you have to. It’s impossible to lead an honest and fulfilling life as a man and not make mistakes and ‘fess up to them when you need to. But it’s especially humiliating when they happen to be so public and so scrutinized.” He continued, “When you have success young, and you accept the good things, you have to accept all of it. You have to accept the moments of glory but also a great responsibility. And that responsibility, to some degree, involves being a role model. At the same time, I’m a human being, and I’ve made a lot of mistakes. I’ve learned from each one.”</p><p>Zac also opened up about his struggle with alcohol and drug abuse at the time, which led to stint in rehab.&nbsp;“I was drinking a lot, way too much,” he said, acknowledging there were drugs, too. “It’s never one specific thing. I mean, you’re in your 20s, single, going through life in Hollywood, you know? Everything is thrown at you. I wouldn’t take anything back; I needed to learn everything I did. But it was an interesting journey, to say the least.”</p><p><span class=s1>Our mission at STYLECASTER is to bring style to the people, and we only feature products we think you’ll love as much as we do.
