Last year, the sector accounted for some 46 per cent of Sri Lankan export revenues, or US$5.93 billion.But amid a challenging global economy, year-on-year export volumes shrank about 11 per cent by March this year, industry statistics showed.

But most of Sri Lankan apparel is made with fabric from places including mainland <a class="euc41pk0 e13op9j60 e1qbu6wp1 css-jgjyn2 ef1hf1w0" href=# data-qa=BaseLink-renderAnchor-StyledAnchor><span data-qa=Component-Text class="css-0 e1qbu6wp0">China</span></a>, <a class="euc41pk0 e13op9j60 e1qbu6wp1 css-jgjyn2 ef1hf1w0" href=# data-qa=BaseLink-renderAnchor-StyledAnchor><span data-qa=Component-Text class="css-0 e1qbu6wp0">Taiwan</span></a> and <a class="euc41pk0 e13op9j60 e1qbu6wp1 css-jgjyn2 ef1hf1w0" href=# data-qa=BaseLink-renderAnchor-StyledAnchor><span data-qa=Component-Text class="css-0 e1qbu6wp0">Thailand</span></a>, and this raises duties by 10 per cent when the EU and the UK import from Sri Lanka.<h3 type=h3 data-qa=Component-Component class="e14khtrb0 css-17x7qa9 e793b7w1"><a class="link-text css-e0dnmk ef1hf1w0" href=# data-qa=BaseLink-renderAnchor-StyledAnchor><p><span data-qa=DigitalArchiveLink-TitleText class="css-66qo9a eeeqn932">India, US interests converge in aid efforts for Sri Lanka crisis</span></p></a></h3><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">As a result, apparel made in Sri Lanka is less price-competitive than that of Bangladesh.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">“[Sri Lanka] has to lobby for better trading terms,” Lawrence said.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">Trouble at larger manufacturing facilities means the smaller factories which operated mainly as subcontractors during better times and took over some of the excess orders, would now get the short end of the stick.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">“This year, we have had to move away from the subcontractors [as the orders declined], so some of those plants will actually shut down,” an executive from a leading apparel manufacturer told This Week in Asia under condition of anonymity.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">The garment industry in 2022 directly employed some 350,000 workers, who are now facing uncertainty amid the turmoil.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/cdn.i-scmp.com/sites/default/files/styles/wide_landscape/public/d8/video/thumbnail/2023/03/21/clean---sri-lanka-IMF.jpg><h3 type=h3 data-qa=Component-Component class="e14khtrb0 css-17x7qa9 e793b7w1">Manpower struggle</h3><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">Factories operating at reduced capacity means the workers no longer receive overtime pay and other production related incentives, leaving them struggling for survival, said Chamila Thushari, Programme Coordinator at Dabindu Collective, a Sri Lankan group advocating for rights of the apparel factory workers.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">“Even with the incentives, they receive only 30,000 rupees per month. Now they buy food on credit and are struggling to pay rent and bills,” she said.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">However, the brunt is borne by the daily-wage employees of the sector, dependent on a “manpower” agency connecting them to some available work, ranging from cutting, washing and packing to cleaning, each day.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">Chandra Devanarayana, the Founder of the Revolutionary Existence for Human Development organisation, puts the estimate of manpower labourers at 19,000 to 20,000 each month. But now, only about 100 jobs are available per day, she said.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">“Now I see them walking around for hours, pleading for work,” she said.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/cdn.i-scmp.com/sites/default/files/d8/images/canvas/2023/05/12/c783edc3-2a44-4b2f-a618-53e513714547_8cb9ca43.jpg><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">As the factories grind to a halt, the effects would also ripple to other services dependent on the apparel industry, from transport suppliers to security companies and caterers. It would also mean the micro economies operating near the factories, such as food vendors and small hostels run by the members of the local community, would contract, at least briefly.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">Shama Gunasekara, 40, a worker from Hanwella town in Sri Lanka’s Western Province, earns around 40,000 rupees a month selling sweets near a large garment factory in the area.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">A sole breadwinner, she said her family of four relied on her income.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">“I am not sure what to do if the factory is not here. It is not profitable to keep a shop elsewhere. I have tried,” she said.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">Lawrence said he was confident the industry could ride out the crisis. But the situation would not reverse for “at least another two quarters”, he said.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tK%2FMqWWcp51kxKaxymaYrKGRZLKku82opKKbo2Sus8DInKOeZ2Nnf3F%2Fj21mrKqZYrmiusqaZKCZoqKyr8CMsKaro5WnwG6ywJycZqKfl3qtu9KsnKxllpawtbvRopysZZykwKZ5wZqloKSRmbK0tIyapKKcXai5sMPDqK6n</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./meghan-markle-nude-one-shouldered-gown-leg-slits-8403912.html><span>←</span><span>Meghan Markle Wore a Nude One-Shouldered Gown With a Trio of Leg Slits on the Red Carpet</span></a>
