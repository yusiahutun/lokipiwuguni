After a small revival with the new Netflix documentary Depp vs. Heard, many people are wondering who is<a href=# data-type=URL data-id=https://stylecaster.com/entertainment/celebrity-news/1344869/amber-heard-now/ rel="noreferrer noopener"> Amber Heard’s baby’s father.</a></p><p>Director Emma Cooper talked about how she didn’t want to interview both Amber Heard and Johnny Depp for the documentary. “Really, my intention,” she told <a href=# data-type=URL data-id=https://variety.com/2023/tv/news/johnny-depp-amber-heard-trial-documentary-netflix-interview-1235697318/ rel="noreferrer noopener">Variety,</a> “Was always to try and make it about the conversation around the trial. I wanted to get away from any he-said-she-said from within the trial, and I just really wanted to talk about us and the way we communicate, and the way that we look at events that don’t really have anything to do with us. That is actually what the series is about — but I can’t help but look at some of the things that are being said about me, without people having seen the series, and it’s interesting that people are drawing many conclusions, but that very much was not my intention.”</p><p>She talked about how the international fame of this case impacted <a href=# data-type=URL data-id=https://stylecaster.com/entertainment/celebrity-news/1267677/johnny-depp-verdict/ rel="noreferrer noopener">the outcome</a>. “In an ideal world, women not being treated the same in public would stop very soon. I’m not naive about that. I see it around me,” she says. “But I do think that Johnny Depp is so famous — he’s a megastar. His fans, they think they’re watching the pirate [on the stand], and they absolutely love him. And he’s got like 25 years [in show business] on Amber. So, it’s a very unusual case. Wasn’t it fascinating just to see how people are deeply in love with the man and the character? It’s the power of Hollywood, really, if anything else.”</p><p>Amber Heard was married to Johnny Depp from 2015 to 2017. Following their divorce, The Stand actress wrote an op-ed in The Washington Post in 2018 about her experiences with domestic abuse. Although she did not mention a name in the article, the public speculated that she was referring to her ex-husband Johnny. Johnny sued Amber in 2019 for defamation, claiming that the op-ed article ruined his career and took away his acting opportunities, as well as his long-standing role in Pirates of the Caribbean. Their <a href=#>trial</a> began on April 8, 2022, in Fairfax, VA.</p><p>On June 1, 2023, the&nbsp;<a rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow" href=#>LA Times</a>&nbsp;put out an article declaring the winning of Depp’s lawsuit. Depp had sued her for $50 million, and Heard countersued for double. The judge awarded Depp $10 million for compensatory damages plus an additional $5 million for damages in the trial. Yet, they were immediately reduced to $350,000. Heard was given $2 million in compensatory damages based on the accusation that “she and her friends created a hoax that included roughing up her apartment to look worse for police,” which was an accusation from Depp’s prior attorney Adam Waldman after the article about assault came out.&nbsp;</p><p>In a final statement, Heard said:&nbsp;“The disappointment I feel today is beyond words. I’m heartbroken that the mountain of evidence still was not enough to stand up to the disproportionate power, influence, and sway of my ex-husband. … It is a setback. It sets back the clock to a time when a woman who spoke up and spoke out could be publicly shamed and humiliated. It sets back the idea that violence against women is to be taken seriously.”</p><p>During her<a rel="noreferrer noopener" href=#> testimony</a> on May 17, 2022, Amber said, “I want to move on with my life. I have a baby. I have to move on. I want to move on, and I want Johnny to move on too.” This is the first public mention of her child who was born on April 8, 2021. Amber announced her child’s birth in an Instagram post on July 2021.</p><p>So who is Amber Heard’s baby’s father?

In her caption, she said, “Four years ago, I decided I wanted to have a child. I wanted to do it on my own terms. I now appreciate how radical it is for us as women to think about one of the most fundamental parts of our destinies in this way. I hope we arrive at a point in which it’s normalized to not want a ring in order to have a crib.”</p><p>She also stated that she wants privacy for her little one. “A part of me wants to uphold that my private life is none of anyone’s business,” she continued. “I also get that the nature of my job compels me to take control of this. My daughter was born on April 8, 2021. Her name is Oonagh Paige Heard. She’s the beginning of the rest of my life.”</p><figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-rich is-provider-instagram wp-block-embed-instagram"></figure><p>It is not known who the father of the baby is.
