When Casey Llewellyn was a teenager in Boston, her mother came to her with some startling news: “She said our family had money and I would never have to work in my life if I didn’t want to. That was extremely terrifying.” Llewellyn, a 37-year-old playwright, says she’d always known her family was well-off—but not like that. “Of course I knew we had money,” she tells me."><meta name=author content="Larita Shotwell"><link rel="preload stylesheet" as=style href=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/paper/css/app.css><link rel="preload stylesheet" as=style href=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/paper/css/an-old-hope.min.css><script defer src=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/paper/js/highlight.min.js onload=hljs.initHighlightingOnLoad()></script>

That was extremely terrifying.” Llewellyn, a 37-year-old playwright, says she’d always known her family was well-off—but not like that. “Of course I knew we had money,” she tells me. “We went on vacations to Europe and ski trips. But my politics at that time were like, ‘Fuck the man.’ And then, suddenly, it was like, ‘Oh, my God, I’m the man.’”</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=2 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">Llewellyn’s mother, Amelie Ratliff, a longtime philanthropist, had actually been trying to start a conversation with her daughter about redistributing wealth—something Ratliff herself has been passionate about since she was young. Growing up in Alabama in the 1960s, says Ratliff, 71, “the contradictions of what I was learning in church—‘Do unto others as you would have them do unto you’—and what I was seeing in the world were stark, and so I looked for other ways of exploring those contradictions.” Ratliff’s family’s money came from financial services, mortgage banking, and real estate. But she says that when she considered the true basis of their wealth, she saw it as “a result of systemic and horrific discrimination, with land acquired from the elimination and removal of Indigenous folks and the labor of enslaved Africans.” And so, she explains, “as soon as I got money, I began distributing it.”</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=3 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">“My mother is very much the reason I’m in this work,” says Llewellyn, referring to her own philanthropy. “She gave me access to my [inheritance] when I was 18 and recommended I reach out to Resource Generation”—a nonprofit organization founded in 1997 under the name Comfort Zone (it changed its name in 2000), which encourages people ages 18 to 35 to donate a large portion of their wealth to progressive causes. Since then, Llewellyn, who now lives in New York, says she has given away all but roughly 10 percent of her wealth to a variety of organizations dedicated to social justice and climate collapse. “I don’t think I’m a rich person anymore, and it feels much better. I think it’s very hard to have money in an ethical way.”</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=4 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">“Casey and I are allies in our work,” Ratliff says. “She pushes me. I’ve gone past where my parents were”—in terms of how much she gives away—“and she’s gone beyond where her mother is. Every wealthy person has to ask, How much is enough? How much do I really need, and how much do I want to make available more broadly?”</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=5 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">A wave of radical giving is underway. The mammoth donations of philanthropic heavyweights like MacKenzie Scott and Melinda French Gates are only the most visible examples of affluent people trying to address America’s outrageous problem of economic inequality and change the way giving gets done. In a viral Medium post this past June, Scott wrote of her “humbling belief that it would be better if disproportionate wealth were not concentrated in a small number of hands, and that the solutions are best designed and implemented by others.” Those “others” are often the recipients of financial grants whose voices have not always been heard.</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=6 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">Llewellyn explains, “That’s the structural change I think we’re going for: giving the power to the people with the expertise and the knowledge, the grassroots organizers and community organizers; giving power to communities that are trying to transform things for themselves.”</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=7 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">Once upon a time, rich women did charity work as a way to gain social cachet (and, of course, some still do); organizing a fundraising gala was an opportunity to wear a designer gown and get your name in the society pages. That way of doing things never appealed to Susan Pritzker, 73. “It always made me super uncomfortable,” she says. “The rubber-chicken dinners with a bunch of fancy people listening to somebody at the pulpit saying, ‘You donors are so fabulous.’ It was very social. It was also transactional. What I was building was my Rolodex, and I could get a lot of people into those rooms because I could afford to go to everybody else’s parties.”</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=8 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">In 1969, Pritzker, then Susan Stowell, married Nicholas Pritzker, a member of the family that started Hyatt Hotels Corporation. (Today he is an independent venture entrepreneur.) “I married into money, so I came into my philanthropy with this sense of, ‘Well, it’s not really mine,’” says Pritzker, who lives in San Francisco.</p><span aria-hidden=true class="css-0 eagam8p0"></span> “Why doesn’t everyone just put on jeans and T-shirts and get together and write letters?” Regan Pritzker recalls thinking.“For the price of the gown, the gala, and the dinner, why don’t we just move the money to the organization?”<span aria-hidden=true class="css-0 eagam8p1"></span><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=10 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">She was all the more uneasy with how the grantees in traditional charity situations were often treated; sometimes they would “get paraded across the stage as exhibits. I would always try to avoid doing that because I knew it was wrong.” She couldn’t stand it when grantees in turn seemed uncomfortable in their interactions with donors, to whom they seemed to feel they were expected to be “deferential.” “That’s why I’m really excited to have found out how to move toward something more empowering to both sides,” Pritzker says. “Really, truly, it all boils down to being constantly aware of where the power dynamic is sitting and asking, Is it in the right balance?”</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=11 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">Since 2019, Pritzker has been on the board of Solidaire Network, one of the charitable organizations that has emerged in the two decades since the founding of Resource Generation. Solidaire’s purpose is to encourage wealthy people to not only donate their money but also change the system that unfairly gives them more of it. (Ratliff and Llewellyn have been members since 2015.)</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=12 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">Conceived in 2012 after the Occupy Wall Street movement started a national conversation about economic inequality, Solidaire was officially launched in 2013 by a group of activists and philanthropists including Leah Hunt-Hendrix, a granddaughter of the late Texas oil tycoon H.L. Hunt and the organization’s first executive director. Today, the group has 244 members, 77 of whom are institutional members or have family foundations of their own. (Ratliff and Llewellyn, for example, sit on the board of the Ratliff Charitable Foundation, and in 2002 Pritzker and her husband and their four children founded the Libra Foundation.) This year, MacKenzie Scott donated $10 million to the organization. Solidaire operates out of 11 regional hubs, serving communities across the country. “Solidaire is a network of donors who are committed to racial justice, to averting the climate crisis, and to making sure that we’re building a future that’s democratic, multiracial, feminist, and pluralistic,” says Rajasvini Bhansali, 46, the group’s executive director since 2018. “By becoming a Solidaire member, people consent to being in a collective project that liberates wealth and funds social movements, grassroots organizing, and what it will take to build a progressive force in the United States that’s lasting and not dependent on electoral cycles.<br></p><img alt="susan pritzker and regan pritzker, 2002" title=HBZ100121_144 width=1689 height=1169 decoding=async data-nimg=1 sizes=100vw src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/hips.hearstapps.com/hmg-prod/images/jp-1633444170.jpg style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center><span class="css-1urwh1q e1geg53v2">Courtesy of Susan Pritzker</span><p>Susan and Regan Pritzker, 2002.</p><span aria-hidden=true class="css-0 eagam8p0"></span>“My politics at that time were like, ‘Fuck the man.’” says Casey Llewellyn. “And then, suddenly, it was like, ‘Oh, my God, I’m the man.’ ”<span aria-hidden=true class="css-0 eagam8p1"></span><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=16 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">“Most of our members have an understanding that the wealth that they have inherited wasn’t just about their merit,” says Bhansali, who started out as a community organizer after studying astrophysics at the University of California, Berkeley. “Much of that wealth comes from a long history of exploitation that took for granted the labor of Black bodies and stolen Indigenous lands. There’s an understanding that it’s their job as donors to actually liberate this wealth in the service of social justice.”</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=17 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">Instead of having donors control how funds get distributed, Solidaire calls upon its grantees to direct the course of change. For example, its Movement Infrastructure Fund “is guided by strategic direction from our advisory committee, made up of movement organizers,” says Bilen Mesfin Packwood, a spokeswoman for Solidaire and the founder and CEO of Change Consulting. “The Black Liberation Pooled Fund is guided by our Movement Oversight Committee, also made up of longtime organizers working toward Black liberation,” Mesfin Packwood says. “Most of our staff has a background in grassroots organizing. We bring that experience and analysis to our work.”</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=18 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">On an annual basis, Solidaire moves about $20 million through its three pooled funds, while its members collectively donate approximately $100 million more on their own. “Our 10-year goal is to move a billion dollars to social justice,” says Bhansali.</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=19 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">One notable recipient of Solidaire’s support has been the Movement for Black Lives. The group’s annual budget was still relatively modest when it began partnering with Solidaire in 2014. “Now they’re one of the most significant change organizations in this country,” Bhansali says. “They’ve become an umbrella organization that’s essentially changing the narrative, changing how we think about anti-Blackness in this country. Without their consistent effort at the national scale, which Solidaire played a part in helping grow, we wouldn’t be in the moment we find ourselves in. As incomplete as the work still is, it’s a pretty significant win of accompanying a movement from early days.”</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=20 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">Regan Pritzker remembers the days when her mother, Susan, would be working on invitation lists and the invitations to charity events had to look a certain way. “My mom’s not a fancy, formal person by any stretch,” she says. “She’s the one who would always be in jeans and a T-shirt, but she would participate in organizing these types of galas.”</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=21 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">Regan, now 49, recalls thinking, even as a child, “Why doesn’t everyone just put on jeans and T-shirts and get together and write letters? I was like, I don’t understand; for the price of the gown, the gala, and the dinner, why don’t we just move the money to the organization? That really resonated for my mother too, but she was working inside of what was happening at the time. It’s just the way things were done—and, of course, it still does happen. I’ve been really heartened to see how it’s evolving, though there’s still so much work to do.” A former elementary-school teacher and cochair of the Libra Foundation board, Regan says she found out about Solidaire in 2017 from Leah Hunt-Hendrix. “We went for a walk and she told me a bit about the history of the group,” she says. Regan was moved “because of the responsive nature of the work and the thinking around how people with access to wealth can lean in to philanthropy in ways that are not perpetuating some of the same patterns of donor-centered giving.”</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=22 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">The influence Susan had on Regan as a philanthropist now came full circle when Regan introduced her mother to Solidaire. “I immediately felt this sense of ‘This is what I’ve been looking for,’” says Susan.</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=23 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">Solidaire’s emphasis on promoting the agency of “the people who are on the front lines doing the work of organizing” was important to Regan from the beginning. She says that after joining the group, she became more educated on how she could help shift the paradigm of giving.</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=24 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">“It’s been essential for me to be in relationships with people who are willing to speak more honestly to me about my wealth,” she says, “who say things to me like, ‘I’m not trying to give you a hard time, but we’re not going to let you off the hook either, and you need to step up. Don’t just write a check and go away. Get into the work with us, jump in and help us, and don’t let it come from your ego; let it come from your commitment to this vision of a transformed society where all people have enough and we can live in a right relationship with the planet.’</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=25 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">“They’re not just telling me, ‘You’re amazing,’” she adds.</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=26 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">Regan confesses to feeling some discomfort at even talking about her involvement as a donor. “I think my role is important, and I take it seriously, but I don’t think of myself as the spokesperson for the work,” she says. “The way society still sees the donor as the celebrity in the story and centers the donor instead of centering the work and the good teams of people that make it possible has got to change. The fact that I’m even having this conversation with you, I find ironic, because I do the least of all the people who work on all the different projects I support.”</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=27 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">Inspired in part by Solidaire, Regan and her husband, Chris Olin, launched the Kataly Foundation in 2020 with the mission of working toward “a world in which Black and brown people have the resources, power, and agency to execute their own visions for justice, well-being, and shared prosperity within their communities.” Nwamaka Agbo, Kataly’s CEO, says the organization began with seed money of $445 million and was “founded intentionally as a spend-out foundation”—which means that “we will be giving away more of our assets than our endowment earns, which allows us to actually divest our assets out of Wall Street and strategically reinvest them into Black, Indigenous, and community- of-color projects that build community.”</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=28 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">Agbo, 37, who comes from a background that includes organizing, says Kataly’s founders have been true to their goal of letting organizers take the lead. “As the board members of Kataly,” she says, “Regan, Chris, and Susan have done a really excellent job of leaning in to their commitment of decentering themselves out of the decision-making that happens around our grants and out of the day-to-day operations of the foundation, so that those of us who come from social movements who are now running the foundation are able to make decisions that are deeply values-aligned and supporting social movements.”</p><span aria-hidden=true class="css-0 eagam8p0"></span>“The way society still sees the donor as the celebrity in the story and centers the donor instead of centering the work and the good teams of people that make it possible has got to change,” says Regan Pritzker.<span aria-hidden=true class="css-0 eagam8p1"></span><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=30 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">The mothers and daughters I spoke with all said they get back more from their giving than they ever give away. “A lot of my life has been spent moving in these donor organizing spaces because I felt as I did, my own humanity was returned to me,” says Llewellyn.</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=31 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">“For me,” says Susan Pritzker, “to narrow my focus and to now be supporting BIPOC-led movement organizations is like a dream come true. It’s exactly where I want to be. Solidaire-type grant-making is still a tiny piece of the pie,” she adds, “but it’s grown so dramatically, and the interest feels explosive. I think it’s in part because of the sense of solidarity, if you will, that’s created among the donor community. Resource Generation was the first to hit on this—this sense [among some wealthy people] of ‘Oh, my God, am I the only person going through this, wanting to do good things with my money without feeling icky?’ For me, it’s very hard to sit with privilege and wealth and not feel a little tainted by it.” Llewellyn agrees: “The negative emotional impact of having money is real,” she says. “Having wealth has damaged us—damaged our resilience, our sense of self-worth. Having things you feel you don’t deserve—because everyone deserves everything equally—can affect your sense of worth. It’s like, we feel fucked up,” she goes on. “And a lot of it, in my understanding, has to do with the isolating nature of wealth.”</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=32 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">To address the discomfort of sitting with wealth and wanting to liberate it into the world, Solidaire offers donors training on “transforming philanthropy, how to have hard conversations with family members, unearthing family stories of wealth accumulation”—which includes uncomfortable truths about the ways families became well-off—“donor organizing around taxation, and talking with your family about abolition and defunding the police,” says Mesfin Packwood.</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=33 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">But beyond the problem of economic inequality, Llewellyn adds, “There’s the reality of where we are with climate collapse. We have to figure out ways to sustain the environment—which also involves finding ways for people to use their expertise, which I feel is what giving to social-justice movements is all about.
