Had only one left, they'd have had to figure out how to end that relationship and move on with the one who stayed. As it is, the wedding between Mike (Adams) and Rachel (Markle) could move forward as planned, and then you just send them both off into the greater world.</p><p>Their inevitable departure came in the form of an offer for Mike to run a law firm in Seattle that would exclusively handle class action law suits against Fortune 500 companies. Even better, the offer was for Rachel to run it with him. Those are the kinds of cases that drew Mike to law in the first place, and yet he was hesitant to step away from Specter Litt after all these years.</p><p>"But Mike, we're young and we don't have any kids yet," Rachel countered. "If we're ever going to do something like this in our lives, now is the time."</p><p>Using the power of television logic, taking the job meant moving up the wedding as they'd have to leave immediately. In other words, let's get this whole thing over with so we can kiss these two goodbye and bring in <strong><a href=#>Katherine Heigl</a></strong> for the Season 8 premiere and send Gina Torres off to lead her own spinoff. The "Suits" empire will live forever!</p><p>But we're getting ahead of ourselves.</p><a class="article-block__link js-track-link" href=# data-node-ref=toofab:article:3abed0cc-8569-52a4-bbb9-d4ac202e4859 data-container-ref=toofab:article:69d5f972-7b2d-5635-9578-9210b66a553c data-context='{"section":"article-block","name":"article"}' readability=27><img src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/images.toofab.com/image/3a/5by4/2018/04/10/3a7cb223c57150e1899510b380494b5e_xs.jpg width=300 height=240 style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center> <span class="media-credit article-block__media-credit">Getty</span><p><h4 class="article-block__card-title article-block__card-title--has-credit">Prince Harry and Meghan Markle Won't Be Inviting the Obamas to Their Royal Wedding</h4><span class=article-block__cta-text>View Story</span></p></a><p>First, a wedding, and a wedding means touching vows. "I know that I fought it at first, but now, Mike, I can't imagine living alongside anyone else for the rest of my life," Rachel said in hers. "You are the strongest man I have ever met. And you make me stronger. You are the husband I've always wanted. And I can't wait to begin our adventure together."</p><p>"From the first second I met you, I knew I wanted to be here with you someday, walking down the aisle, arm in arm," Mike responded in his vows. "If I've learned one thing, it's that we never know what the future holds. And that can be a scary thing. But I know that there is nothing that I can't handle when I have you by my side."</p><p>Mike waited until after the wedding to break the big news to Harvey (Gabriel Macht), who was poised to offer Mike senior partnership. After having a heart-to-heart with his mentor and best friend, Mike took to the dance floor for a final scene and a final dance with Rachel.</p><p>It was an appropriate ending for Markle, as she moves on now to the royal wedding with Prince Harry on May 19. We imagine the two events will be quite different.</p><a id=gallery-link-fbe9c237-3983-52d8-90d8-d8fd8ff7895c class="media-link gallery-block__link js-track-link js-click-gallery" href=# data-node-ref=toofab:gallery:fbe9c237-3983-52d8-90d8-d8fd8ff7895c data-poster-image-ref=toofab:image-asset:image_jpg_20171127_8e0429ac7df0533ab82a622f58649707 data-start-at-poster data-context='{"name":"gallery-block","section":"permalink"}' data-container-ref=toofab:article:69d5f972-7b2d-5635-9578-9210b66a553c data-gallery-layout=carousel><img src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/images.toofab.com/image/8e/4by3/2017/11/27/8e0429ac7df0533ab82a622f58649707_md.jpg width=825 height=618 style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center></a> <span class="media-credit gallery-block__media-credit">Getty</span><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmisn6Szoq6NnKamZ2Jlfnl7j21ma25fnby4edKuoK2rXaiuqrCMn5irnaeaua1506hkpp2Xna6vecyaqaSklWK2r3nSnpisp55ihG6yyKeYpZ1dp7y6rctmrp6clJ67qHs%3D</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./helen-hunt-mad-about-you-reboot-151183.html><span>←</span><span>Helen Hunt Looks Forward to Rebooting Mad About You and Finding Love Again!
