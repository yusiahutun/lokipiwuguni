Reilly’s phone call to Will Ferrell that ended ‘best thing in Hollywood’</h2><p>Will Ferrell and Adam McKay once owned one of the most iconic production companies of all time Gary Sanchez Productions, bringing us Step Brothers, Anchorman, and Talladega Nights.</p><p>However, it all came to an end when McKay began to work on the HBO doc, Winning Time, about the LA Lakers, the Elf star’s favorite basketball team. Of course, he wanted to play the role of majority owner Jerry Buss, however, it went to Michael Shannon, which Will was reportedly “fine with,” <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">according</a> to the Hollywood Reporter.</p><p>Shannon then reportedly dropped out of the <a href=#>TV</a> series just a week before filming began, and instead of McKay giving the role to his partner Will, he actually gave it to John C. Reilly.</p><p>Being the good friend he is, Reilly felt ‘obligated’ to give his Step Brothers co-star and best friend a “heads up,” that he was taking the role.</p><p>Speaking to the publication, Mckay said he “f***** up” by not reaching out to Ferrell beforehand. &nbsp;Will was very hurt that I wasn’t the one to call him, and I should have.”</p><p>Around this time, Will and Adam announced they were shutting down Gary Sanchez Productions, but in the statement said they would “always work together creatively and always be friends.”</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading id=h-will-ferrell-and-john-c-reilly-s-friendship>Will Ferrell and John C. Reilly’s friendship</h2><p>John, who was friends with both <a href=#>celebrities</a>, remained impartial, telling The Hollywood Reporter: “Will is one of my best friends, Adam is one of my best friends, I was delighted to get the job and that’s all I really have to say.”</p><p>The duo have one of the most iconic friendships on and off screen and have often ‘gushed’ about each other during interviews.</p><p>In an interview on Jimmy Kimmel Live, the two <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">said</a> they “developed a real relationship.”</p><p>Speaking to the Irish Independent on the first time they met, the 58-year-old <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">said</a> the first time he met Will, he realized working together was, “why we were put on this Earth”.</p><p>Related Topics</p><p>MORE CELEBRITY STORIES</p><span></span><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7pLHLnpmroaSuwaqwwaKrZ5ufonxzfJFsZmpoX2eAcMPIpaNmnpWnv6a4y2armqOZo7RuuMCsq2almaPCtbGMqZ%2BoppVisKK4y2acp5yVmXqwusRmpp9lpJ2ybq7ErKtmrJieu6i%2FjKKlZqCfobm6w86om2g%3D</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./the-weeknd-shade-selena-gomez-new-song.html><span>←</span><span>Weeknd Shades Selena Goemz's Kidney Transplant in Song</span></a>
