Katy Perry visited saucy Sapphire in Las Vegas and Emma Watson went to a strip club in New York.</p><p>Even Princess Eugenie has been spotted at a pole-dancing venue, leading many to believe that the hot new trend is for girls to enjoy it as much as men.</p><p>It’s been reported that there’s been a 30% rise in women intrigued by lap-dancing, a statistic confirmed by the clubs themselves.</p><p>Jane Hurlow is manager of Secrets strip club in Hammersmith, west London (secrets-clubs.co.uk). She says: “About 20% of our visitors are women and there are several different scenarios in which they come in.</p><p>“They could be in a couple – a male customer bringing his girlfriend or wife as a way to spice up their relationship – or girls coming in with a group of male friends or as part of a hen night. We also have lesbians coming in.</p><p>“As a club we are very female friendly. As a female manager I am more than welcoming to girls who come in to enjoy the show. After a few drinks many women want to have a go themselves.”</p><p>While the benefits for blokes are obvious, what do girls get out of it?</p><p>JENNY PAUL</p><p>JENNY PAUL, 35, is a writer from Bristol. She regularly visits strip clubs with her boyfriends and female friends for a “different” night out, and to enjoy the late night bar.</p><p>Jenny says: “I started going to strip clubs in my early 20s. I was bored with regular clubs playing generic dance music and full of drunken teens. I first tried gay clubs and was then introduced to strip clubs when looking for a late night haunt.</p><p>“I’d happily go with my boyfriend or with a group of female friends. They aren’t sleazy and as a woman I can appreciate how hard it is for the girls to dance like that.</p><p>“They must have incredible upper body strength to spin upside down on the pole. The costumes are amazing and it’s generally just a really good show.</p><p>Plus my fella is so much more attentive when we get home! “I’m very open-minded so the nudity doesn’t bother me and I would spend as much as I would on a normal night out.</p><p>“If Rihanna’s a fan it must be worth a look!”</p><p>KIM WILLIS</p><p>KIM WILLIS, 29, is a writer from The Isle of Wight.</p><p>Kim says: “I am proud to say I’ve been to a strip club with my dad!</p><p>“We were on holiday with my friend Nicola in Patong, Thailand, and my dad wanted us to experience one so we could see what they were like.</p><p>“As we walked down the street deciding which strip club, or go-go bar to enter, we were heckled left, right and centre by men offering out discounts to “ping pong shows”.</p><p>“We picked a venue and headed inside When the performance started, I couldn’t believe it – not just stripping but a show with ping pongs, bananas and even a budgie coming out of the most unlikely places.</p><p>“On the whole the women seemed happy. The strippers were all so beautiful and slim. They had huge smiles on their faces.</p><p>“It didn’t feel seedy. I thought I was going to feel insulted that women could be objectifi ed in such a way, but I really didn’t. Their dance moves were elegant and tasteful, despite their lack of clothes.”</p><p>THE STRIPPER</p><p>KATE KLINT, 25, from London, is a pole-dancer who says she is seeing more female clients than ever.</p><p>Kate says: “I have been stripping for three years now and I’ve noticed more women coming into the clubs over the past year. It’s easier to talk to girls in the club than to men. They don’t stare as much and they are less leering than male customers.</p><p>“I have to say I feel more pressure to perform well in front of women, though.</p><p>“Men enjoy watching our bodies and are interested in looks, but girls like to see a good show. When I ask them what they’re looking for they usually tell me they’re curious and just want to see what it’s all about.</p><p>“I like dancing for them, because I feel like I’m showing them something new.</p><p>“Big groups of girls sometimes come in at weekends They are usually very drunk and just out to have a good time.</p><p>“I love it that Rihanna wasn’t ashamed to go into a club – it makes them seem less seedy and more of just a different place to have a good time.”</p><p>THE SEXPERT</p><p>BEHAVIOUR expert JUDI JAMES says: “A large part of the appeal of strip clubs is the sense of power and status it gives the punters, especially the high end of the market where the atmosphere is intended to be classy rather than seedy and clients buy the dances openly.</p><p>“This feeling of enhanced power will affect women as much as, and possibly even more, than the guys. Girls can feel that they’re getting one over on the fellas by invading their territory and being cool about it rather than being intimidated by the sexuality of the strip.</p><p>“High-status business women in particular can feel stronger by celebrating their success in the same way men have done for centuries.</p><p>“Even their body language changes to illustrate the power-posturing. Girls in strip clubs tend to spread out more, using dominant gestures and louder voices.</p><p>Some will even tuck money into the strippers costumes or pay for a lap-dance just like the guys do. “Mimicry is common for a female audience, too, meaning the girls watching will often be picking up tips, hence the rise in popularity of pole-dancing classes.</p><p>“Men often make the mistake of thinking girls dress and behave primarily to attract men when our core motivational values in fashion, style and movement are to please ourselves and to impress other women.</p><p>“There’s also a form of pseudo-sexual enjoyment. Women love watching other women’s bodies, which is why artists like Rihanna and Beyoncé, who wear skimpy clothing on stage and gyrate in a sexual way, are still primarily popular with a female audience.”</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7pa3IpbCsrJGne6S7ja6iaKaVrMBwuMCtnKysXaOyuL%2BOrZ%2BeZZKWv6Z50p6vZmloZ4N1hJdw</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./putri-cinta-age-height-boyfriend-career-biography-wiki-net-worth-salary-more.html><span>←</span><span>Putri Cinta Age, Height, Boyfriend, Career, Biography, Wiki, Net Worth, Salary &amp;amp; More</span></a>
