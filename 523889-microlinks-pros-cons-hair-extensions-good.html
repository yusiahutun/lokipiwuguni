The look is simple to achieve if you have long, natural hair. But hair extensions will do the trick if you don't have long hair. Synthetic hair extensions such as weaves and microlinks will add length and thickness to your short, natural hair.</p><h2>What are microlinks?</h2><p class=align-left>Microlinks is a hair extension that looks almost similar to a wig. But, the hair stylist uses tiny copper or aluminium metal beads to attach individual hair extensions to small sections of your natural hair. Unlike other hair extensions, such as <a href=#>crotchet braids</a>, microlinks do not require any braiding.</p><a class=c-article-read-also__image-wrapper href=#><img sizes=256px style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/netstorage-tuko.akamaized.net/images/f18d9e1c96777cd2.png></a><a class=c-article-read-also__headline href=# readability=27><p class=c-article-read-also__caption>Read also</p><p class=c-article-read-also__headline-wrapper><span class=c-article-read-also__headline-hover-inner>10 latest weaves in Uganda that will look really good on you</span></p></a><p class=align-left>The hairstylist will part the hair into small sections and apply the beads at the root of each section. Like all the other hair extensions, microlinks have their own advantages and disadvantages. Here are all the details you need to know about microlinks pros and cons for black hair.</p><h3>What are the benefits of microlinks?</h3><p class=align-left>There are several benefits of adding microlinks to your hair. These include:</p><h4>1. They work on any hair type</h4><p class=align-left>One of the benefits of microlinks is that they can be applied to any hair type because they are blended into <a href=#>natural hair</a>. But you need to ensure you choose the hair extension that matches your hair texture.</p><h4>2. They are natural-looking</h4><p class=align-left>Microlinks also easily blend with your natural hair and are a natural-looking alternative to crotchet extensions.</p><h4>3. Easy way to add volume and length</h4><p class=align-left>Microlink hair extensions are the ideal choice if you want to add volume and extra length to your natural hair. The hairstyle is quite versatile, and there are so many styles that have been created by hair stylists from different countries.</p><a class=c-article-read-also__image-wrapper href=#><img sizes=256px style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/netstorage-tuko.akamaized.net/images/9a2e599e5a1430b1.png></a><a class=c-article-read-also__headline href=# readability=27><p class=c-article-read-also__caption>Read also</p><p class=c-article-read-also__headline-wrapper><span class=c-article-read-also__headline-hover-inner>20 plain lines hairstyles without braids for natural hair</span></p></a><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/netstorage-tuko.akamaized.net/images/f18d9e1c96777cd2.png><h4>4. They can last up to 3 months</h4><p class=align-left>How long do microlinks last on natural hair? With proper maintenance, they can last for <a href=# rel="nofollow noopener">two to three months</a>. But you should not keep the extensions in your hair for too long because they can cause hair damage.</p><h3>What are the disadvantages of Microlinks?</h3><p class=align-left>Some of the downsides of getting micro links include:</p><h4>1. It's not a protective style</h4><p class=align-left>If you are shopping for a protective hairstyle, microlinks are not a good option. The hairstyle requires you to regularly wash and condition your hair for best results.</p><p class=align-left>You need to visit the hairstylist every few weeks so that the hair can be washed and hydrated. The hair stylist will also fix any beads that have started slipping.</p><p class=align-left>Do microlinks grow your hair? You should not install microlinks to grow your hair because they do not promote hair growth. Your hair will grow at the same pace it would in its natural state.</p><a class=c-article-read-also__image-wrapper href=#><img sizes=256px style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/netstorage-tuko.akamaized.net/images/4c7862c87c29d11e.jpg></a><a class=c-article-read-also__headline href=# readability=27><p class=c-article-read-also__caption>Read also</p><p class=c-article-read-also__headline-wrapper><span class=c-article-read-also__headline-hover-inner>20 cute birthday hairstyles for a Black girl to rock in 2024</span></p></a><h4>2. It's expensive</h4><p class=align-left>You should also be prepared to dig deeper into your pocket to achieve this look. To install the microlinks, you need to purchase hair extensions and microlinks and pay the hairstylist.</p><h4>3. Doesn't work on extremely short hair</h4><p class=align-left>Another disadvantage is that you cannot install microlinks on short hair. If you have short hair, you should wait for it to grow to at least four inches long before you can try this hairstyle.</p><h4>4. Not the best hairstyle for weak hair</h4><p class=align-left>The hairstyle is also not ideal for weak hair because it can break it. If you experience excessive hair shedding, the weight of hair extensions will cause more damage. It is imperative that you consult your hairdresser to advise you on whether your hair is strong enough to handle the microlinks hair extensions.</p><h4>5. The installation process is time-consuming</h4><p class=align-left>The hairstyle is also time-consuming. The process of attaching the beads to the separate sections of your natural hair can take between four and six hours, depending on the speed of the hairdresser.</p><a class=c-article-read-also__image-wrapper href=#><img sizes=256px style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/netstorage-tuko.akamaized.net/images/a44272f3f839258f.png></a><a class=c-article-read-also__headline href=# readability=27><p class=c-article-read-also__caption>Read also</p><p class=c-article-read-also__headline-wrapper><span class=c-article-read-also__headline-hover-inner>20 hairstyles for men with big foreheads that will look great on you</span></p></a><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/netstorage-tuko.akamaized.net/images/9a2e599e5a1430b1.png><h2>Wrapping up</h2><p class=align-left>Microlinks pros and cons are the only tools you have at your disposal to know if the hair extensions are good for you. The benefits of microlinks outweigh the drawbacks.
