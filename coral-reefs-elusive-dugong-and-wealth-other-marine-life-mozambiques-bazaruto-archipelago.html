Every day, our people will go out fishing in dhows. It is a way of life and part of our culture; every family is involved,” Huo says, as he recalls how he would go out with his brother after school most days to fish.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">Huo says he moved to Vilanculos for work but found the lure of the island too strong to resist. In 2016, he returned to Benguerra and joined the pre-opening team at Kisawa, which launched in 2022.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">With just 11 palatial residences spread across 300 hectares (741 acres) on the southern tip of the island, it is like a billionaire’s hideaway, with little more than the thatched roofs of pavilions peeking out from behind undulating dunes.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">Kisawa’s opening sets a new bench­mark for conservation-led hospitality and tourism in Mozambique, and Huo, who is activities and community liaison manager, is excited.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/cdn.i-scmp.com/sites/default/files/d8/images/canvas/2024/04/05/a5881553-8f68-4b33-a02d-83f317cc7999_26e04747.jpg><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">He credits tourism with the development of the island, saying that “before the arrival of the lodges, there were no schools, clinics or reliable water supply”, all of which have been funded by the resorts.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">They are also closely bound to the community as major employers, with almost all staff coming from the island and surrounding regions. As a result, Huo says, there is strong support among villagers for the resorts.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">Personally, it allows him to dream of becoming a divemaster, an idea that once seemed inconceivable.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">For all the beauty I’ve seen, the best is saved until last. Unlike my arrival, during high tide, my departure by helicopter to Vilanculos international airport coincides with low tide.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/cdn.i-scmp.com/sites/default/files/d8/images/canvas/2024/04/05/acef6a87-2e7a-481c-a512-3a7a872e5dcd_4785c901.jpg><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">On the short flight back, the archipelago unfurls in all its majesty below me, an otherworldly vision of vanilla ice cream swirls and streaks of sand coursing through the azure sea.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">In deeper parts, circles of coral and dark blue channels are visible, ones that guide whales, dugongs and other wildlife to this African sanctuary.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">Soon after my visit, the IUCN Red List of Threatened Species declared dugongs in East Africa critically endangered, one step away from extinction.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">Although their numbers are in jeopardy, the listing does at least give the last of Mozambique’s dugongs added profile and protection, and provides all the more reason to travel to this extraordinary country.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tK%2FMqWWcp51kuaqyxKyrsqSVZMGzrdWeo2aklZ7Atr7EaJirrJmYuaZ7kmtscHFoa3yku9Gao2aqlZqztHnEpaysoaaaeqXBxqiloGWRo7Fuw8Sao62gXaTBqbHRZqSaqpmjsm64yJ%2BcZqWfr66ursiqrJ6rXZeuu63RrquoZZGnsKm1z56jmp%2Bf</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./6617008a22601d941c8b458e-html.html><span>←</span><span>Conor McGregor vs Michael Chandler could be announced ahead of UFC 300, per report</span></a>
