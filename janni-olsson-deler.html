She started travelling when she left her home in Sweden back in 2013. Initially, the motive for starting a blog was to file her memories of different places on the website. The driven woman also made it her goal to share it with the world. After Janni started her blog in 2013, she garnered a huge following; it gained popularity in Sweden. She started blogging so she could record all her trips in the form of writing. Later, the model felt like it was not enough. She wanted to do much more than that. There was a strong interest in fashion, styling and photography. That is why she started sharing her fashion and styling advice and modelling for her blog. Again, this is another reason why she started a YouTube channel.</p><p>Janni developed an interest in shooting places, photography, and editing. She has been interested in fashion and styling since she was a kid. Colours and style mattered to her. The talented model has been featured on popular magazine covers, including Vecko Revyn, a Swedish lifestyle magazine. She has collaborated with famous brands like Nikon, Maybelline and Calvin Klein.</p><p>Janni achieved prizes for being Lifestyle Blogger of the Year and Fashion Blog of the Year for her fashion work. Her Instagram account has 1.4 million followers. She works through her social channels for influencer marketing. One thing led to another, and Janni started improving and posting rich content. It is her love for learning, styling and modelling that helped her reach where she is on this day.</p><p>Delér has done some design collaborations so far. She loves creating, and the fashion blogger aspires to have her clothing brand with her designs shortly. There is a high possibility that this woman will make the most out of her modelling and styling career in the fashion industry.
