The film was inspired by real-life street gang the Jets, founded by Barone</p><p>Infamously gruff but co-operative at the same time, Barone last year said: 'I’m 85. I don’t remember the specifics. I was in a war [referring to the Second World War]... I killed a lot of people.<br></p><p>'And I was in a war on the West Side of New York.

He even landed the son of boss Vincent 'The Chin' Gigante a lucrative industry job.<br></p><p>He was a man of terrifying brutality but also a man of honour - serving a seven-year jail term in the 1980s without spilling any details of the Mafia operations.<br></p><p>But he decided to flip in 2001 after Mob boss and one-time friend Gigante put a contract on his head.<br></p><p>‘I went bad,’ he said.&nbsp;</p><p>Barone earned a grudging respect from his federal handlers. FBI spokesman James Margolin told the New York Daily News: ‘George Barone’s criminal conduct cannot be ignored, but neither can the immense value of his expert insight and testimony.'<br></p><p>Barone said he was edged out of the Mob by a new generation of gangsters who tried to strip him of his union control and then plotted to kill him.</p><p>He said: 'They’ve been trying to kill me for years now.
