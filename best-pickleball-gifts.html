Personally, my knowledge of the best pickleball gifts feels somewhat limited (err…I know you use rackets!), but my mother-in-law is practically a pickleball pro. It’s a regular and much-loved activity in her 55+ community, and she’s even traveling to Turks and Caicos for a dedicated pickleball trip (yes, they actually do those now). If anyone has good suggestions for <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">pickleball presents</a>, it’s her, which is why I tapped her for a few ideas.</p><p>Related Stories</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/stylecaster.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/03/Outlander.jpg> <img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/stylecaster.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/11/Outlander.jpg><p>Table Of Contents</p><p>Of course, I made sure to add some pickleball gifts for beginners and fashion-friendly ideas of my own (TBH, I’m now contemplating giving the sport a shot — pun intended), but for the most part, this list is for someone who really loves the game. My mother-in-law made sure to mention the essentials during a brief phone call (while she was playing golf, something else she also enjoys!), ranging from expensive gear to must-have accessories.</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading id=accessories>Paddles</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/stylecaster.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/11/Selkirk-Paddle.jpeg><p>“There are different levels of paddles, depending on your ability,” my mother-in-law tells me. This <a rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow" href=#>Selkirk paddle</a>, for instance, is highly rated among intermediate to advanced pickleball players. It’s thinner than many models out there and made from a blend of fiberglass and carbon fiber, which allows for some serious spin and power.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/stylecaster.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/11/Pickleball-Paddles.jpg><p>Although my mother-in-law enjoys dressing up, she’s not super tempted by paddles with prints and patterns. When I asked if she wished for a cuter option, she told me “not really,” noting that it’s more about performance than anything else. However, <a rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow" href=#>this collaboration</a> between Rykä and popular pickleball brand Recess is essentially the best of both worlds, combining cute graphics with a quality design that includes a fiberglass surface, honeycomb core, and a sweatproof foam grip. A great gift for someone who is just getting started.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/stylecaster.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/11/ONIX-Graphite-Paddle.jpg><p>If the pickleball lover in your life is getting better at their game, they might be in search of a lighter paddle.

It’s actually a trend that I, a non-player, have been noticing, too. While dedicated pieces (including athletic dresses) do exist, she prefers to wear skorts on the court, similar to this one from Athleta. It features a pocket for your phone and a pocket for a ball, and also ranges in size from XXS – 3X.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/stylecaster.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/11/Nike-Shorts.jpg><p>Of course, fitness shorts are another game essential. Your favorite pickleball player will likely appreciate this high-waisted, layered pair from Nike, which will allow them to jump around and lunge for the ball without worrying about whether they’re flashing someone.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/stylecaster.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/11/On-Tshirt.jpg><p>I actually feel like breaking a sweat just thinking about playing pickleball, so naturally, stretchy, breathable, moisture-wicking clothing is a must on my gift-giving list. If I were to pick a practical pickleball present, it would probably be this <a rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow" href=#>performance T-shirt</a><a rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow" href=#> from On</a>, which a player could easily wear both on the court and off.</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading id=accessories>Shoes</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/stylecaster.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/11/Asics-Pickleball.jpg><p>Although so many sneakers are now labeled specifically for pickleball, my mother-in-law swears they’re “similar to tennis shoes.” Personally, I’m into this pair from ASICS, since they’re simple, sleek, and well-reviewed, with customers highlighting the great grip. Also, if you’re gifting someone who is into fashion, it’s worth noting that Kaia Gerber has been rocking this brand for months.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/stylecaster.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/11/NB-Pickleball-Sneakers.jpg><p>Like with most pickleball gear, some sneakers are better suited for indoor courts rather than outdoor ones.
