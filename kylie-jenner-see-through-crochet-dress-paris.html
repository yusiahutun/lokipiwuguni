The problem? They had to submit a birth certificate ASAP, so they "just put Wolf Webster in that moment," a decision Jenner regrets. "Right after I signed the birth certificate, I was like, 'What did I just do?'" she told her mom, adding that her son's name "hasn't been changed legally yet," because "Travis actually still changes his name a few times."</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=9 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">"He'll come back and be like, 'I really like this name.'
