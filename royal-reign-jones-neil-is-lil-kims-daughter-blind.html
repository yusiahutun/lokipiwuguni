Although she has an eye condition, it has not impaired her vision. As she continues to grow, Royal Reign Jones Neil’s eyes appear to be correcting themselves, and she may not require any treatment or surgery.

According to medical information, it is usually not heritable. However, dominant inheritance is possible.</p><p>Several reports suggest that Congenital Ptosis can result from genetic defects, chromosomal defects, or damaged nerves weakening the muscles. This condition can affect one or both eyes and may be present at birth or acquired later in life. Additionally, it can also affect both genders.&nbsp;</p><p>Aside from being in the headlines as a celebrity kid, Royal has been the subject of several rumors about her sight. From fans asking why she has lazy eyes to asking if the adorable kid has impaired vision.&nbsp;</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/gistfest.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/fotor_2023-6-8_10_10_15.jpg><h2 class=wp-block-heading><span class=ez-toc-section id=Meet_Royal_Reign_Jones_Neils_Father></span>Meet Royal Reign Jones Neil’s Father<span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h2><p>Lil Kim had Royal Reign Jones Neil with Mr. Papers, whose real name is Jeremy Neil.
