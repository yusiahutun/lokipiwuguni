She could always say no, and that’s the first time that I’ve been on the carpet pitching somebody! So, a little nerve-racking, of course.”</span></p><p dir=ltr><span class=x_ContentPasted0>In September 2018, Daymond shared that he married Heather in front of a group of their closest friends and family members.&nbsp;</span></p><p dir=ltr><span class=x_ContentPasted0>“It was [a great day].

Calm, private and out of the spotlight,” he wrote on Instagram. “We would get married 5 years ago today in the small church of the school I went to as a little boy in Queens, New York. No big lights and cameras. Just a small gathering of our beautiful friends and family as you can see from the pics of our mothers and my guys from the hood.”</span></p><h2 dir=ltr><span class=x_ContentPasted0>How Many Children Does Daymond John Have?</span></h2><p dir=ltr><span class=x_ContentPasted0>Daymond is a dad of three kids.
