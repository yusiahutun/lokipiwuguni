Chris Hemsworth’s trainer Joseph Sakoda, nicknamed Da Rulk thanks to his insanely buff body, says we really don’t need to be sweating it out for hours at a time and lifting super heavy weights.
Instead, all we need is between five and 30 minutes — and our own bodyweight.
Joseph, who trains actors like Chris and Josh Brolin, as well as police, fire, and military service personnel, uses a method of exercise called raw functional training."><meta name=author content="Martina Birk"><link rel="preload stylesheet" as=style href=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/paper/css/app.css><link rel="preload stylesheet" as=style href=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/paper/css/an-old-hope.min.css><script defer src=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/paper/js/highlight.min.js onload=hljs.initHighlightingOnLoad()></script>

We’ve found one for you. Chris Hemsworth’s trainer Joseph Sakoda, nicknamed Da Rulk thanks to his insanely buff body, says we really don’t need to be sweating it out for hours at a time and lifting super heavy weights.</p><p>Instead, all we need is <a href=# rel="dofollow noopener noreferrer">between five and 30 minutes</a> — and our own bodyweight.</p><p class=inline-stn-player></p><p>Joseph, who trains actors like Chris and Josh Brolin, as well as police, fire, and military service personnel, uses a method of exercise called raw functional training.</p><p>This way of training doesn’t focus on how many pounds you can squat or deadlift and instead focuses on mostly bodyweight movements, with exercises like bear crawls, push-ups, burpees, lunges, and mountain climbers featuring heavily.</p><p>“These are all bodyweight movements designed to help people be more functional,” Joseph told Good Health.</p><p>“I wanted to create a training program that didn’t require weights. It makes it easier, especially for people with busy schedules. You can do this in a hotel room, or in your living room while you’re watching your kids.”</p><p>And the best part? You only need to add on between five and 30 minutes of Joseph’s bodyweight exercises into your routine, between one and three times a week, to get fit and lean fast.</p><p>“If you love Pilates or yoga or spin, keep doing that!” Joseph said. “Just add this in one or two times a week.”</p><p>So, what would Joseph recommend if you’ve only got five minutes to spare for a workout?</p><p>“I would probably put together three to five movements in a sequence.”</p><p>And yes, even Chris Hemsworth sticks to this sort of short, sharp and efficient exercise routine. So, if it’s good enough for Chris, it’s good enough for us!</p><p>“[Chris’] schedule is so crazy. He’s always moving around and he doesn’t have two hours to train,” Joseph said.”My focus was to incorporate training into his day. So a 25 to 30 minute HIIT session gets the body moving.”</p><p>The duo focus on bodyweight movements that get the heart rate up and use Chris’s own body mass to build strength and condition his body.</p><p>But while Joseph is all about smashing it in the gym, he says rest days are super important too. “I’m a firm believer in rest days. Sometimes I think recovery is more important than the training itself,” he said.</p><p>“People always say, ‘Be a beast, go after it!’ But if you train every day, you’re more susceptible to injury and your form is compromised.</p><p>“I think that’s what people forget and you forget to stop. If you never allow your body to recover, then it can be really unproductive.”</p><p>He added, “So let’s focus on recovery, making sure we warm-up and cool down properly.”</p><p>This article originally appeared on our sister site, <a href=# rel="dofollow noopener noreferrer">Now to Love</a>.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7p7XRrKufp6KsvK6xzWeaqKVfpby0wNJom6KdpGSwqb7IrGShnZ2oxLC%2B06FkbmWdnru2wMRmrqiqm6TCtXmQcGpvbGY%3D</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./bees-antisocial-autistic-html.html><span>←</span><span>Bees that are antisocial may be autistic</span></a>
