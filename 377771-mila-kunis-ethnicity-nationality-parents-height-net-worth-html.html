Growing in the Soviet Union was not easy for her Jewish family. She has previously revealed that anti-Semitism was one of the main reasons why <a href=# rel="nofollow noopener">her family relocated</a> to the United States of America.</p><p class=align-left>Here are some interesting facts about the origin, early life, education, career, and love life of the celebrity.</p><h3>What ethnicity is Mila Kunis?</h3><p class=align-left>Mila is a Ukrainian born to mother, Elvira (physics teacher who run a pharmacy in the US) and father, Mark Kunis (a mechanical engineer who became a cab driver in the US). Mila Kunis family also includes an older brother, Michael, who is a biochemist.</p><p class=align-left>Is Mila Kunis Japanese? No. The actor is Ukrainian and not Japanese, as most of her followers believe.</p><a class=c-article-read-also__image-wrapper href=#><img sizes=256px style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/netstorage-tuko.akamaized.net/images/d0cac3233501bac2.jpg></a><a class=c-article-read-also__headline href=# readability=27><p class=c-article-read-also__caption>Read also</p><p class=c-article-read-also__headline-wrapper><span class=c-article-read-also__headline-hover-inner>What happened to Tonya Renee Banks from Little Women LA?</span></p></a><h3>What race is Mila Kunis?</h3><p class=align-left>Mila is white by race, considering that she is Ukrainian by birth and of Ashkenazi Jewish ancestry on both sides. The star spent most of her early years in the Soviet Union adapting much of the local culture. Besides, her full names are a clear reminder of the white race and Ukrainian ancestry.</p><h3>Does Mila Kunis speak Russian?</h3><p class=align-left>Yes, the celebrity is even better in Russian than the English language. The family mastered the native Russian language before moving the US in 1991 when Mila was barely seven years old.</p><p class=align-left>Her bilingual nature is, in fact, an added advantage in her career. For instance, she speaks Russian in the ending of Family Guy, an animated TV show in which she stars the role of Meg.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/netstorage-tuko.akamaized.net/images/c2c85bbbdf7b9222.jpeg><p class=align-left><strong>READ ALSO: </strong>Chloe Ting facts: age, ethnicity, nationality, plastic surgery, rise to fame</p><h3>Early life in the US</h3><a class=c-article-read-also__image-wrapper href=#><img sizes=256px style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/netstorage-tuko.akamaized.net/images/0392214a50593119.png></a><a class=c-article-read-also__headline href=# readability=31><p class=c-article-read-also__caption>Read also</p><p class=c-article-read-also__headline-wrapper><span class=c-article-read-also__headline-hover-inner>Annamarie Tendler bio: height, net worth, wedding, parents, what happened</span></p></a><p class=align-left>Mila's family, including her grandparents, moved to the US <a href=# rel="nofollow noopener">through a lottery system</a>. Staying in Los Angeles was not easy at first because her parents had given up their good degrees and jobs to seek peace for her and Michael.</p><p class=align-left>They only had 250 dollars and suitcases upon arrival in America. The differences in language and culture was another issue.</p><h3>Mila Kunis education</h3><p class=align-left>The actress recalls arriving in Los Angeles and enrolling for studies a couple of days later. Starting school at Rosewood Elementary School was challenging, given that she was not an English speaker.</p><p class=align-left>However, by third grade, she was fluent in English. Her then best friend, Maria Osadchy, also Russian, helped her learn English.</p><p class=align-left>Mila then <a href=# rel="nofollow noopener">attended</a> Hubert Howe Bancroft Middle School. She studied there until high school prior to filming for 'That '70s Show' in 1998 at the age of 14 years.
