She died in a car accident last month on the fifteenth, and I’ve just been lost since”</p><p>Carley&nbsp;Ann Harrielle was killed in a car accident in August. She was going to be a senior at Milledgville High School. Although the team had been planning on running the marathon already, now the motives changed.&nbsp;</p><p>“They surprised Chris and made the t-shirts and made the emblem in memory of Carley and they said they’re running for Carley today,” said Carley’s mother Dawn Harrielle.&nbsp;</p><p>“This team here assembled today for a reason and that reason was to bring joy to a very difficult and sad situation for people we love,” said relay member Anthony Welty. “We were just glad we were able to come out and do what we set out to do.”</p><p>By sporting Carley’s name and number on their shirts as they crossed the finish line, they were able to carry her with them and keep her legacy alive.</p><p>“And really all we want to do is keep her alive,” said Harrielle. &nbsp;“Keep her memory alive in everything that we do. And that’s what these guys did for us, they brought her here to the Quad Cities with them and ran their hearts out.”</p><p>“We miss her so much,” said an emotional O’Brien. “She was going to have a great senior year. She’s not here anymore, but she’s here with us today, I know she is.”</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7sMHRqqyanJOewaqx0meaqKVfo7K4v46qmmalkaeutbTOp2SrnZyWxm7DyKelnqqjYr%2B2us2ipaBllqS%2FbrnOq5xmrJiWu26tjKacnZmcZA%3D%3D</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./brothers-osborne-fourth-studio-album-self-titled.html><span>←</span><span>Brothers Osborne Reveal Self-Titled Fourth Studio Album</span></a>
