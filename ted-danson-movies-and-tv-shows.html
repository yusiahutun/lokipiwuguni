Danson, however, has said he was the complete opposite of his character. He recalled on The Late Show with Seth Meyers, “<a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">It took me a year and a half on Cheers</a> playing Sam Malone [to feel comfortable]… I never went to bars, I never picked up women.”</p><p class=inline-stn-player></p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.firstforwomen.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2024/03/2_0656e7.jpg><p>His ability to put a comedic spin on everything he said and did in Cheers won him multiple awards, as well as a star on the <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">Hollywood Walk of Fame</a> in 1999.</p><p><strong>MUST READ: </strong><a href=#><strong>‘Cheers’ Cast: 11 Wild Behind-the-Scenes Secrets Revealed</strong></a></p><h2 class=wp-block-heading>Ted Danson early career</h2><p>Ted Danson was born in 1947 as Edward Bridge Danson III in San Diego, California. The actor attended Stanford University where he became interested in acting, and soon transfered to Carnegie-Mellon University, where he got his Bachelors in drama. A few years after his 1972 graduation, Danson moved to Los Angeles where he studied and taught classes at the Actor’s Institute.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.firstforwomen.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2024/03/3_df865a.jpg><p>Early on in his career, Danson had a few small roles on multiple television series, his first bout with the medium being the daytime soap opera Somerset (1970). Though his role was minor, it was the first time Danson was seen on screen.</p><p>Afterwards, he made appearances on The Doctors (1975), The Amazing Spider-Man (1979), <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">B.J. and the Bear</a> (1979), <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">Laverne & Shirley</a> (1980) and Magnum, P.I. (1981).

Danson’s character, though a philandering, newly sober bartender, was a joy to have on the screen. His charming demeanor and good looks — accompanied by a truly great ensemble of actors — drew in an audience of nearly 26 million viewers weekly.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.firstforwomen.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2024/03/6_3cd98c.jpg><p>Though the show struggled initially, many tuned in every Thursday to see the passionate, on-again, off-again relationship between Sam and Diane Chambers (<a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">Shelley Long</a>). Danson remained on the series for the entirety of its 11-year run, even after Diane left. But in season 6, audiences met Rebecca Howe (Kirstie Alley), who played his next love interest.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.firstforwomen.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2024/03/5_699cd3.jpg><p>Danson won two Golden Globes and two Emmys for his role in the series. He recalled his time on the show to Entertainment Tonight in 2022, reflecting, “<a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">It still makes me laugh</a> when I watch sometimes. It’s funny and it’s great to see my friends and they make me laugh. I was so blessed.”</p><p>In 1993, Danson decided the series and his time as an aging player needed to come to an end. The last episode of Cheers, which pulled in a whopping 80.4 million viewers, was the second most-watched TV series finale of all time.</p><p><strong>MUST-READ: </strong><a href=#><strong>Kirstie Alley Young: Take a Look Back at the Career of the ‘Cheers’ Actress</strong></a></p><h2 class=wp-block-heading>Ted Danson movies and TV shows during Cheers</h2><p>Throughout his time on Cheers, Danson’s film career soared, his roles during the show’s early years including Cowboy (1983), Allison Sydney Harrison (1983), Little Treasure (1985) and Just Between Friends (1986).</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.firstforwomen.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2024/03/7_68bc49.jpg><p>In 1984, Danson was cast opposite <a href=#>Glenn Close</a> in the Emmy-winning film Something About Amelia, for which he scored a second Golden Globe award.
