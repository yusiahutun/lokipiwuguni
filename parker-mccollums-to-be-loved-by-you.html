If you like a narrative, you can call this Part 2 in his quest for true love and subtitle it "Karma." There's nothing to indicate the two mid-tempo rockers are connected ever, even if vocally McCollum delivers each in a similar range. His voice is unique and easy to identify, if not overly dynamic within this small sample size.</p><p>Producer Jon Randall does well to keep focus on that voice through most of the song, however, as the 28-year-old brings a certain everyman quality to his songs. It's easy to insert&nbsp;your own tale of trouble love within the spaces of his verses.</p><p>With grit and simple poetry, he makes a familiar tale personal and accessible, delivering with the kind of energy you eagerly pay money to see live. Most of all, McCollum&nbsp;sings&nbsp;"To Be Loved&nbsp;by You" with the assurance of a man who knows he'll be around to offer Part 3.</p><figure class="img-tag has-sizer aligncenter" readability=2><p><span class=visually-hidden>to be loved by you cover art</span></p>MCA Nashville<p>loading...</p></figure><p><strong>Did You Know?</strong>:&nbsp;McCollum wrote "To Be Loved&nbsp;by You" with '90s hitmaker <a href=#>Rhett Akins</a>, who is also father to<a href=#> Thomas Rhett</a>.</p><p><strong>Parker McCollum's "To Be Loved&nbsp;by You" Lyrics:</strong></p><p>Hell maybe I’m right, maybe I’m wrong / Finding out why shouldn't take this long / Easier said than done I guess / I'm a little bit harder to love than the rest / Why does this have to be so hard / Doin’ my best to hold your heart / And I, I’ll never let it go again.</p><p><strong>Chorus:</strong><br>So why are you always angry / Why are you always quiet / Why do you sleep alone / When I know you don’t like it / Maybe you might be different / Would it kill you to tell me the truth / What in the hell does a man have to do / To be loved by you.</p><p>Well I've been running as fast as I can / And you’ll never get over what you can’t understand / Pissed off, hanging up the telephone / Forever ain’t far, I’m heading home / Maybe I’m right, maybe I’m wrong / Last time you ever gonna find me gone / And I, I’ll never let you go again.</p><p><strong>Repeat Chorus</strong></p><p><strong>Repeat Chorus</strong></p><p>To be loved by you / To be loved by you / To be loved by you.</p><a class="next-post cto" href=#>Next: See the Top 40 Country Songs of January 2020</a><p><h2 class=photogallery-title>These Are Country Music's All-Time Best Love Songs</h2></p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmiskajBprvFnKaupqSnxm%2BvzqZmqZmioLKzecycmqiknKq6tHnTqGSbnV2hvLexw2aZsmWppMJw</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./greys-anatomy-viewers-paid-1000-dollars-to-watch-show.html><span>←</span><span>How you could be paid $1000 to watch Greys Anatomy</span></a>
