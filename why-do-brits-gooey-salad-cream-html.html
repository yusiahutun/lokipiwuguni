 New recipe: Heinz are introducing a new fancy lemon and black pepper version of its classic salad cream
 Back in 1940, George Orwell described Britain as 'the most class-ridden nation under the sun' - and you have only to catch a stranger sneering at the contents of your supermarket trolley to realise that not much has changed."><meta name=author content="Larita Shotwell"><link rel="preload stylesheet" as=style href=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/paper/css/app.css><link rel="preload stylesheet" as=style href=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/paper/css/an-old-hope.min.css><script defer src=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/paper/js/highlight.min.js onload=hljs.initHighlightingOnLoad()></script>

It may have a new, middle-class disguise, in the form of Heinz's new fancy lemon and black pepper version, but it's fooling no one: salad cream is as unpretentious as a slab of Spam.</p><p>Growing up in the home counties, salad cream was something to be employed only in an emergency, a way of drowning out the sad flavour of school canteen iceberg lettuce and sour tomatoes - even now, the thought of the stuff sends a nostalgic shudder down my spine.</p><p>At home, it was mayonnaise all the way. Salad cream thus acquired the same misguided exoticism as my other school-dinner favourites, corned beef and spaghetti hoops.</p><p>Until recently, I wasn't alone - the tide seemed to be turning in favour of continental upstarts like mayonnaise and vinaigrette, and in 1999, Heinz announced it was considering scrapping its salad cream.</p><p>A public outcry, spearheaded by the Mail and backed by super-fan Roy Hattersley, resulted in a deluge of letters to Heinz, including one from the Houses of Parliament's catering committee (presumably representing the Commons, rather than the Lords), and salad cream lived to fight another day.</p><p>As the incident proved, the British have a deep-seated affection for salad cream. As Lynsey Hurst, senior brand manager for Heinz Salad Cream, explains: 'Salad cream is uniquely British . . . and a real memory-jogger - many people remember the first time they tried it.'<br></p><h2>RELATED ARTICLES</h2><ul class="rotator-pages link-xocc"><li class=rotator-prev><a href=# data-page=prev>Previous</a></li><li><a href=# data-page=1>1</a></li><li class=rotator-next><a href=# data-page=next>Next</a></li></ul><ul class="rotator-panels link-bogr1 linkro-ccox"><li><a href=#><img src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/i.dailymail.co.uk/i/pix/2010/09/01/article-1308102-041323F9000005DC-501_87x84.jpg width=62 height=60 style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto> <span>The healthy heart diet - more fruit and veg with a dash of smoked salmon</span></a></li></ul><h2>Share this article</h2><span class=wai>Share</span><p>But while a recipe for English Salad Sauce appeared in Eliza Acton's 1845 Modern Cookery For Private Families, and a rather sharp salad cream made it into Mrs Beeton's Househol d Management, it took a U.S. firm to popularise this most British condiment.</p><p>Indeed, salad cream was the first product developed by Heinz specifically for the UK market and took eight years to perfect, finally appearing in grocers' shops in 1914. In those days, much of the preparation was done by hand in the company's West London kitchens, with the jars packed into straw-lined barrels for transportation - the target was 180 dozen a day, with a halfpenny bonus for every 12 extra the workforce produced.</p><p>The condiment quickly established itself as the perfect accompaniment to a traditional British garden salad - probably the rather common kind containing hard-boiled eggs and sliced tomatoes. But it wasn't until the outbreak of World War II that it really came into its own.</p><img src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/i.dailymail.co.uk/i/pix/2010/09/02/article-1308233-0561C997000005DC-728_468x394.jpg height=394 width=468 alt="A third of Britons are said to have a bottle of salad cream in their homes" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto><p class=imageCaption>A third of Britons are said to have a bottle of salad cream in their homes</p><p>With tomato ketchup off the menu, trusty salad cream was there to lend an edge to the dull fare available. Indeed, it was a key ingredient in such dishes as Mock Crab - a vile concoction of margarine, vinegar and cheese that when combined is meant to taste like the shellfish - and 'Victory' jacket potatoes, which were essentially jacket potatoes with salad cream.</p><p>Pickle people Crosse & Blackwell introduced a rival salad cream in the late Fifties, and even upmarket Waitrose stocks its own brand, albeit in its value 'Essentials' range. But Heinz remains the market leader: the nation consumes 14,200 tonnes every year, with East Anglians the biggest fans.</p><p>Salad cream recently became available in the U.S., to the delight of British expats, and is sold in Australia and parts of Africa. But nowhere has it achieved the iconic status it holds here - a third of Britons have a bottle of Heinz Salad Cream in their cupboard.</p><p>Aficionados still seek out the traditional glass bottles, which they claim contain a thicker sauce, while warning novices to stay away from pub-style sachets. 'I don't know what they put in those packets, but it isn't salad cream,' one grumbles online.</p><p>Salad cream's great rival, mayonnaise - which, many think, originated in Mahon, the capital of Menorca, in the 18th century - simply wasn't an option for most people until Hellman's appeared here in 1961. But thanks to the likes of cookery writer and Europhile Elizabeth David, who once snootily described salad cream as 'one of the major culinary disasters of this country', 'classy' mayonnaise benefited from the relentlessly aspirational nature of the British public.</p><img src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/i.dailymail.co.uk/i/pix/2010/09/02/article-1308233-0AC16488000005DC-87_233x423.jpg height=423 width=233 alt="Main rival: Salad cream's chief rival mayonnaise" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto><p class=imageCaption>Main rival: Salad cream's chief rival mayonnaise</p><p>Like spaghetti Bolognese, quiche Lorraine and Black Forest gateau, mayonnaise signified cosmopolitan sophistication in a way salad cream, once so nationally beloved that it was known as the 'English sauce', did not.</p><p>But the tanginess that made it so popular during the war still appeals to the British palate today: salad cream sits proudly alongside such spicy national favourites as piccalilli, horseradish and chilli sauce.</p><p>Like mayonnaise, it contains egg yolks, vegetable oil and mustard - but the principal difference lies in the amount of vinegar, as well as the water, which helps to thin down the sauce to a pouring consistency.</p><p>You can, of course, make your own, and many chefs believe they can improve upon the original. Richard Corrigan, for example, made a version on BBC2's Great British Menu using equal quantities of evaporated milk and rapeseed oil, whisked together with caster sugar, English mustard, white wine vinegar, salt and pepper.</p><p>Simon Hopkinson also has a decadent version involving double cream and six egg yolks in his book The Prawn Cocktail Years. But they never taste quite the same as the real stuff. As Heinz's Lynsey Hurst tells me, this 'unique flavour means it keeps a loyal following - it's difficult to replicate'.</p><p>Mindful of changing tastes, however, Heinz has dared to tweak the recipe for the first time in its 96-year history. The limited-edition lemon and black pepper variant is designed to appeal to palates seasoned by 'increased travel, more confidence in the kitchen and increased eating out'.</p><p>Lynsey doesn't explicitly say they're trying to appeal to a more middleclass market, but after telling me it's great in prawn linguine and chicken quesadillas, she doesn't have to.</p><p>Gingerly, I squirt some onto a piece of lettuce. The distinctive vinegary flavour familiar from school dinners of yore is followed by a kick of zesty lemon and a hint of spice - Mediterranean flavours that are as much of a shock to me as finding Parma ham in a jar of common-orgarden meat paste.</p><p>But traditionalists be warned. Lynsey hints that this is only the 'first step to some really exciting times for Heinz Salad Cream'.</p><p>So could we all be dolloping sweet chilli or pesto salad cream onto our fish finger sarnies and boiled egg salads in future? Heinz isn't saying - but it looks as though a long-standing British love affair might have another few years in it after all.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7pa3IpbCmmZmhe6S7ja6iaJ6Voq6quI6fpqicX5a%2FtbXCpZxmaWNlhXN%2FkmiOobFdeZxujtGiq6xll6S8psWMjJilmZRikLOxwKZloaydoQ%3D%3D</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./the-meaning-of-oriental-poppies-by-georgia-okeeffe.html><span>←</span><span>The meaning of Oriental Poppies by Georgia O'Keeffe</span></a>
