In November 2015, the couple confirmed they were indeed seeing each other when the “Cool” singer’s rep released a statement about their relationship.</p><p>“Gwen and Blake are longtime friends who have very recently started dating.” they said, according to <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Us Weekly</a>. Since then, the duo have been doing absolutely everything together and they don’t care who sees! Just last month, they <a href=#>spent Thanksgiving together in Oklahoma</a> and they brought both of their families along for the ride.</p><p>“We all fly out to Oklahoma, like 30 of us,” Gwen explained about their tradition to <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Entertainment Tonight</a>. “Blake has this bed and breakfast hotel that we all stay at, and it’s just pretty incredible. We have fun, we all cook together, it’s fun.”</p><p>As for how Gwen and Blake got together, well, they both bonded over their divorces to their former spouses. In July 2015, the “God Gave Me You” singer separated from <a href=#><strong>Miranda Lambert</strong></a> — whom he married in May 2011 — and, in the same year, Gwen called it quits with <strong><a href=#>Gavin Rossdale</a></strong> — whom she married in September 2002.</p><p>“A lot of life had happened and we’d been through a lot, and we bonded actually over that,” Blake previously admitted to <strong>Martina McBride</strong>&nbsp;on her “<a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Vocal Point</a>” podcast. “And it’s one of those things that, who knows? It had to have been meant to be.”</p><p>You can say that again! The two are so in love that Blake might want to tie the knot with Gwen very soon. “I just never thought in my wildest dreams, on paper, a cowboy and a ska-like girl from Anaheim would be hanging out, but it works perfect and we’re just having so much fun and we just feel so blessed to be at this point in our lives,” the No Doubt rocker once shared on <a href=#>Today</a>.</p><p><strong>Scroll below to read Gwen and Blake’s cutest quotes about marriage!&nbsp;</strong></p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7pLjOrJyrr5WauK3FjZympmegpMC1v46grp6mXajBprLAp6BmmZ6ZeqO4wKScZquYmrm1u81mqp6dXam1prXRZpmeq6Rivra7056qZqeeYrqivtGimKCdXw%3D%3D</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./farm-chic-fall-fashion.html><span>←</span><span>Farm Chic Fall Fashion</span></a>
