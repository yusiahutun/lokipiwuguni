But perhaps one of the soapiest moments arrives when soon-to-be princess Lady Diana Spencer stumbles upon a design belonging to her fiancé.

Diana correctly then assumes that the young prince is still in love with his ex.</p><img alt="diana camilla at ludlow races" title="Diana & Camilla At Ludlow Races" width=1600 height=2400 decoding=async data-nimg=1 sizes=100vw src="https://cdn.statically.io/img/hips.hearstapps.com/hmg-prod/images/lady-diana-spencer-and-camilla-parker-bowles-at-ludlow-news-photo-1605558318.?resize=320:*" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center><span class="css-1urwh1q e1geg53v2">Express Newspapers</span><span class="css-5ck6gj e1geg53v0">//</span><span class="css-1urwh1q e1geg53v1">Getty Images</span><p>Lady Diana Spencer and Camilla Parker Bowles together in 1980.</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=5 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">What might be even more surprising is that this moment wasn’t made for TV; it, in all likelihood, stemmed from actual events. According to author Catherine Mayer, who wrote a <a href=# data-vars-ga-outbound-link=https://www.amazon.com/Charles-Heart-King-Catherine-Mayer/dp/075355593X data-vars-ga-ux-element=Hyperlink data-vars-ga-call-to-action="biography of Prince Charles" class="body-link css-1gunp80 emevuu60">biography of Prince Charles</a>, “Curled venomously amongst a pile of wedding presents and cards, Diana had discovered a bracelet bearing the initials ‘GF,’ intended for Camilla.” Author Andrew Morton wrote in his book about Princess Diana: “Despite firm remonstrations from the Prince’s righthand man,” the young Lady Spencer demanded to open a package that had arrived at the palace, and in it, she found the engraved bracelet. According to <a href=# data-vars-ga-outbound-link=https://www.radiotimes.com/news/on-demand/2020-11-15/the-crown-charles-affair-camilla-cheating/ data-vars-ga-ux-element=Hyperlink data-vars-ga-call-to-action=RadioTimes class="body-link css-1gunp80 emevuu60"><u>RadioTimes</u></a>, she knew of the nicknames not because Camilla had told her, but because she’d picked up on them from Charles’s friends and a note he’d left behind.</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=6 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">There’s some dispute about this, however. According to Jonathan Dimbleby, a former BBC journalist who wrote Prince of Wales: A Biography, the initials actually stood for “Girl Friday,” another nickname Charles had for Camilla based on the film His Girl Friday. (It’s worth noting: Dimbleby was the journalist interviewing Charles when the heir <a href=# data-vars-ga-outbound-link=https://www.nytimes.com/1994/06/30/world/prince-charles-in-tv-documentary-admits-to-infidelity.html data-vars-ga-ux-element=Hyperlink data-vars-ga-call-to-action="admitted to his infidelity" class="body-link css-1gunp80 emevuu60"><u>admitted to his infidelity</u></a> on TV.) Either way, the bracelet was a gift for his ex, and it arrived mere days before he met Diana at the altar.</p><img alt="trh prince charles the duchess of cornwall attend blessing at windsor" title="TRH Prince Charles & The Duchess Of Cornwall Attend Blessing At Windsor" width=3600 height=2688 decoding=async data-nimg=1 sizes=100vw src="https://cdn.statically.io/img/hips.hearstapps.com/hmg-prod/images/clarence-house-official-handout-photo-of-the-prince-of-news-photo-1605558367.?resize=640:*" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center><span class="css-1urwh1q e1geg53v2">Pool</span><span class="css-5ck6gj e1geg53v0">//</span><span class="css-1urwh1q e1geg53v1">Getty Images</span><p>Prince Charles and Duchess Camilla, with their children, after their wedding in 2005.</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=8 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">In the documentary <a href=# data-vars-ga-outbound-link=https://www.netflix.com/title/80221317 data-vars-ga-ux-element=Hyperlink data-vars-ga-call-to-action="Diana: In Her Own Words" class="body-link css-1gunp80 emevuu60">Diana: In Her Own Words</a>, the Princess of Wales reveals the story behind her tearful breakdown upon Prince Charles's departure to Australia and New Zealand, only days before their wedding. "The most awful thing had happened before he went," she said. "I was in his study talking to him about his trip. The telephone rang; it was Camilla...And then someone in his office told me that my husband had a bracelet made for her.</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=9 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">"I walked into this man's office one day and I said, 'Oh, what's in that parcel?' And he said, 'Oh, you shouldn't look at that.' So I opened it and there was the bracelet. I was devastated." She proceeded to tell her sisters she couldn't marry Prince Charles; they told her it was "too late to chicken out."</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=10 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">Charles and Camilla continued their relationship throughout his marriage to Diana, and they eventually married in the years after the Princess of Wales's tragic car accident. However, though the couple seem very happy together, they faced their fair share of backlash when their infidelity went public.
