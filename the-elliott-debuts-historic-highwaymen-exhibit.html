Dubbed the “Highwaymen,” the self-taught artists sold their paintings out of the trunks of their cars as they traveled Florida’s highways. It is estimated that the group sold more than 200,000 paintings. Today, Highwaymen paintings are displayed in the Smithsonian, and all of the member artists are represented in the Florida Artists Hall of Fame.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.stuartmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/141/2023/03/An-original-Highwaymen-painting-on-view-in-Highwaymen-—-From-the-Street-Corner-to-the-Smithsonian.22-1024x683.jpg><p>The “Highwaymen—From the Street Corner to the Smithsonian” collection features paintings that have never been exhibited. While many works focus on well-known Florida landscapes, many of these exhibit paintings tell different stories, depicting people, animals, and intimate vistas. There also will be an extensive “Canvas Board Wall” of early works, including some by founding member Harold Newton, along with a Tribute Wall to Roy McLendon, who was inspired to pursue art by his neighbor, Newton.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.stuartmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/141/2023/03/An-original-Highwaymen-painting-on-view-in-Highwaymen-—-From-the-Street-Corner-to-the-Smithsonian.--300x200.jpg><p>Stop by during opening weekend for a lineup of activities from 10 a.m. to 5 p.m. Throughout the weekend, McLendon, who is one of seven living Highwaymen, will host live painting demonstrations. Noted collectors Roger Lightle and Steve Carr will host gallery walks, while a film crew captures footage for an upcoming documentary. Catherine Enns, author of The Journey of the Highwaymen, will host a presentation and book signing.</p><p>For more information, click <a href=# rel=noopener>here</a>.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tMDUmqmtpZGcrru1zZ5lnKedZMGptc2gqmasn2KxsHvAq6auppRiwbDDzWaroaGenMBuwM5mm6hnpJ2ybrHLpaCorKRisaau1K2qZqCZqMGwvsicZKGhl53EosXMnqVmnaidtqO102g%3D</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./man-56-jumps-death-upper-east-apartment-building-nyc-html.html><span>←</span><span>Man, 56, jumps to his death from Upper East Side apartment building in NYC</span></a>
