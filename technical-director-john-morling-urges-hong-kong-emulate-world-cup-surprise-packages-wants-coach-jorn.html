Both associations have to balance developing local players, and bringing in good players from overseas who qualify to represent them.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">“The stadiums are better in Hong Kong, but they are government owned. Everything is evolving here, though. It is better than five years ago, and I believe in five years it will look a lot better than it does now.”</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">The HKFA’s stated aim is to qualify for the 2034 Fifa World Cup finals and Morling said that target is not as outlandish as it might appear, pointing to the successes of Iceland, Croatia and Qatar.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">Iceland, with a 382,000 population, were 2016 European Championship quarter-finalists and qualified for the 2018 World Cup. Croatia built teams that reached the 2018 World Cup final, and semi-finals in 1998 and 2022, from a population of 3.85 million. Around 2.7 million people live in Qatar, which has won the past two Asian Cup titles.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">“We have more than seven million people, although not all can play for Hong Kong,” Morling said. “You can watch an under-16 game where 25 per cent of players don’t qualify – the passport rules are more stringent than in a lot of countries.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">“We have to balance local development with long-distance recruitment [of players living abroad with Hong Kong passports], to ultimately deliver better individuals for the senior team.”</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/cdn.i-scmp.com/sites/default/files/d8/images/canvas/2024/04/23/e6fb657a-5eda-416c-a116-cfcf1ef5a31c_7f7aafa0.jpg><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">Morling sets great store in carefully crafted games programmes for young players. The Hong Kong under-16 team is currently in Spain for a tournament also featuring the hosts, Scotland and a Murcia Selection, and last month played friendlies against two local teams in Japan.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">“The mark of a youth development programme is how many players get to the first team, not the trophies you win at under-14 and under-16.”</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">Morling wants to explore opportunities for more private investment in youth development.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">“There is not a lot of investment right now, but a lot of our grass-roots programmes are marketable,” he said. “It might be attractive for companies to become involved in the development of young players, because we are one of the few sports where, if we get it right, we galvanise the whole of Hong Kong.”</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/cdn.i-scmp.com/sites/default/files/d8/images/canvas/2024/04/23/145a357d-8e28-453a-928d-63e4356a947f_fb4f1e1c.jpg><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">Morling and Andersen have quickly formed a good relationship, even though the Englishman is constantly “freezing” in the office, because “Jorn always has the air-conditioning on”.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">“He is really passionate about wanting to do well for Hong Kong, and wants the best development programme possible,” Morling said. “His enthusiasm is infectious … I hope he stays for a long time.”</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">Among seven goals laid out in the HKFA’s Vision 2025 is the desire for “an ever-improving Hong Kong senior men’s representative team”. Tactics for achieving that goal include all Hong Kong men’s teams “adopting a basic playing formation of 4-3-3, with agreed variations”.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">Morling is on record saying the strengths of the players available should govern formations.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">“I need to see how that is working – I would not say something worked for me elsewhere, so it is definitely going to help here,” Morling said. “If something is working, leave it alone. If it is not, we will fix it with something different.”</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">Morling recognises the imperative of communicating to his bosses “the stages we have to go through to grow”.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">Morling’s contract is for only two years, but he hopes to be around “a long time”. He had 12 years with Peterborough United, where he coached three players, Sean St Leger, Luke Steele, and Ryan Semple, who all now work in managing, coaching or scouting.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">At Brighton, Morling spent a decade, from 2012, overhauling an academy that today is a breeding ground for elite footballers.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">“We are going to give it a good go, build on the work that’s been done, and see where we get,” Morling said. “We want to be a force at some point … it is an exciting time for Hong Kong football.”</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tK%2FMqWWcp51kwLG70a1mn6efqa%2BiuMtomKusmZi5pnuSa21paGVlfLWxwqGlopuRoXqltdGemq2nomK3sLTNZqSoqpyeu6h51Kuenqtdnbyvs4ykpqefXZq6trjArZxmr5%2BnuaV5wq6nZqulp72ztdKeZKmZk6CuqLHSZq6apqSoeqS7wJyfZqKfp7uAuc6drKWdbam8savSraarsValtLXFz550rK2SqLKkwMiopQ%3D%3D</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./redzone.html><span>←</span><span>RedZone Chris Coyier</span></a>
