Moss even had four children with Libby Offutt (two daughters- <strong>Sydney</strong> and <strong>Senali</strong>, and two sons- <strong>Thaddeus</strong> and <strong>Montigo</strong>). Though he never officially pledged his vows with the mother of his children.</p><img id=postimg src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/img.marriedwiki.com/uploads/2019/01/31/randy-moss-with-libby-offutt-and-their-children-1548910736.jpg width=450 height=294 style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto><p><span class=imageCaption>Randy Moss with Libby Offutt and their children</span></p><p><span class=imageSource>SOURCE: Slim Celebrity</span></p><p>Randy Moss and Libby Offutt were together since high school. Back then this interracial couple faced a lot of bullies. Together since high school, the pair faced frequent racial taunts and threats in Rand, West Virginia, which even became worse after their first child was born during their senior year. Things went upside down for Moss when the provoked led him to get in a school fight which then ultimately cost him Notre Dame scholarship.</p><p>With his career taking such a toll even before it started, Randy then decided to struggle what's left of it with his then high school love. And with 14 seasons of NFL, Libby and four children, Moss looked like he was having it all despite that early downfall.</p><p>But it wasn't quite over for Randy, not at least off the field. Randy would've never thought that he was going to have such a chunk of ups and downs in his first-ever love, Libby.&nbsp;</p><p>Things plummeted at such a rock bottom for Moss and Libby that at the final moments before their separation, the footballer even went on to accuse his former girlfriend of blowing his <strong>$4 million</strong> worth of money on drugs and abandoning their kids. However, on the other hand, Libby kept on denying Moss's accusations.</p><p><strong>Recommended:</strong> <a href=# rel=noopener>California Senator Kamala Harris Enters 2020 US Presidential Election</a></p><p>She instead explained to have been drug-free for several years and further added that her ex-boyfriend was trying to distance the children away from her. While forwarding the results of her drug tests which showed no signs of any substance abuse, Libby told TMZ that Randy was against letting her meet the children at Christmas.</p><p>"I drove 4 hours on the 26th to take my kids their Christmas presents and his wife wouldn’t let me see the kids or even leave their presents for them.&nbsp;He was mad and acted very immature, saying false things that the children are gonna read eventually, subjecting them to more unnecessary emotional stress. And why bash the woman that brought 4 of your children into this world?!"</p><p>After this, Libby somewhat became a thin air among the media. Likewise, whether Moss is finally allowing her to visit the children or not, still remains a story yet to unravel.</p><p>But speaking of bad past, Randy also doesn't possess a clean slate as around his time with Libby he became quite infamous for domestically abusing <strong>Rachelle Washington</strong>(one of Randy's girlfriend).</p><img id=postimg src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/img.marriedwiki.com/uploads/2019/01/31/rachelle-washington-1548911027.jpg width=450 height=392 style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto><p><span class=imageCaption>Rachelle Washington</span></p><p><span class=imageSource>SOURCE: The Baller Life</span></p><p>After surviving and escaping the difficult situation with Libby, more drama followed Moss in January 2008 (the week before the Super Bowl), when he got a restraining order filed against him by Rachelle Washington.</p><p>Randy allegedly physically assaulted her, which later he only described as an “accident.” The retired did confess a “friendship” with Rachelle during the previous 11 years but explained that he was never having an affair with her. In fact, according to the footballer, Washington was only after him rather with the interest for his money.</p><p>Moreover, Moss's lawyer, in an e-mail to the Boston Globe, in turn, accused Washington's attorney giving blatant threats and attempts to extort money from Moss.</p><h2>Quick Facts: Randy Moss</h2><img id=postimg src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/img.marriedwiki.com/uploads/2019/01/31/randy-moss-1548911156.jpg width=450 height=600 style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto><ul><li>Randy Gene Moss was born on February 13, 1977 (age 41), Rand, West Virginia.</li><li>He began his high school education first with DuPont (Belle, West Virginia) followed by College, Marshall<br>and later taking himself all the way to the NFL Draft in 1998.</li><li>The former Wide Reciever holds the NFL records, 23 receiving touchdowns in a single season, and 17 receiving touchdowns in a rookie season.</li><li>He stands at the height of 6 ft 4 inches.</li><li>His net worth is <strong>$25 million.</strong></li></ul><p><strong>Be sure to check out<a href=# rel=noopener> Marriedwiki.com</a> for more entertainment and articles.</strong></p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmilkae%2FqrHDsKCkoV6YvK57wKuropucmnyiucSroJyZnmKzsLvTm5ilpJWnerOtzZ2wZqWfqMBuus6tZLKdpGK6or7RopydZaSkerGt0a2lnqpdobajrthmpp%2BepanBbrLIp5tmp6WpeqKuzq6rZqCZqHqissWaoKurXZa7pXnDmquippdiv7a5zquq</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./alamour-the-label-formal-dresses.html><span>←</span><span>Alamour the Label Has the Trendiest Formal Dresses For Under $200</span></a>
