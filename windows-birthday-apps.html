Your family or friends might forgive you once or twice, but there are only so many second chances they'll give.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>To stop it from evolving into a habit, here are some Windows birthday apps carefully selected to save you from further embarrassment. With these birthday apps on Windows, you’ll receive prompt reminders to drop a wish right when the clock strikes midnight.</p><h2 id=calendar>1. Calendar</h2><p>Through this personal calendar application, you can schedule appointments, set reminders, or manage tasks. This is why it's a handy tool that lets you stay on top of different events, including birthdays.</p><p>You can easily access it through its shortcut tucked in the bottom-right corner of your screen. Click on the time and date on your taskbar, and a full version of the calendar will spring right up on your screen. Tap on <strong>Show agenda</strong> to view the full version.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static1.makeuseofimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2022/06/setting-birthday-reminder-on-calendar.jpg> <strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Once a reminder's set, you will receive a pop-up notification at the bottom of your screen on the day and time you've placed it.</p><p>The advantage of using this is that it's straightforward and already installed on your Windows device. However, if you still feel the need to explore and try out third-party applications that are strictly birthday-oriented, we've got a couple of recommendations.</p><p><strong>Download: </strong><a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Mail and Calendar</a></p><h2 id=mybirthdays>2. MyBirthdays</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static1.makeuseofimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2022/05/MyBirthdays-birthday-list.jpg><p>With an easy-to-use interface, this Windows birthday app’s specifically designed for all the birthdays you’d like to keep track of. A list of birthday entries (whether <strong>by name</strong> or <strong>by birthday</strong>) is accompanied by adorable birthday muffins.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>lthough they sleep for almost the entire year, they aren’t just for display purposes. A candle sitting atop the open-eyed, smiling muffin means the birthday’s today or fast approaching, making them more noticeable among a list of sleeping muffins.</p><p>Users can tweak the app’s <strong>Settings</strong> and decide when they want to be reminded for each birthday (e.g., 7 days prior to the actual date), or let the app send out a birthday email directly, wishing your loved one on your behalf. Maybe, you can <a href=#>send them over a virtual cake</a> as well.</p><p>However, MyBirthdays has limited functionality as users can’t import birthdays from their contact list or link the app to social media. If you can compromise and manually enter the birthday details of your loved ones, MyBirthdays is relatively straightforward to use, making it accessible for people with minimal tech knowledge.</p><p><strong>Download</strong>: <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">MyBirthdays</a></p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=birthday-hub>3. Birthday Hub</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static1.makeuseofimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2022/05/birthday-hub-contact-card.jpg><p>True to its name, Birthday Hub’s an all-in-one app for all birthday-related activities. It breaks down the birthday list by <strong>Recent anniversaries </strong>(that just passed by) and <strong>Upcoming anniversaries, </strong>displaying the birthday month and the number of days left for friends’ birthdays, what day it will fall on, etc.</p><p>Tapping on a friend’s name brings up their display card, revealing their star sign and how old they’ll turn on their next birthday.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static1.makeuseofimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2022/05/birthday-hub-reminder.jpg> <strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Based on providing its users convenience and added functionality, there's no need to open the app and search for upcoming birthdays manually. The app’s set to start a live countdown on Start Menu tiles days before the actual day.</p><p>Additionally, users can select an exact time and date when they want to be reminded, which prompts a silent birthday reminder in the Notifications Bar. All this gives you an edge to plan ahead of time and maybe give your favorites a surprise. However, if that's not possible, here's <a href=#>how you can uniquely celebrate their birthday online</a>.</p><p>Birthday Hub’s packed with multiple features, but a few are locked and require in-app purchases before the users can enjoy the app fully. Without the Pro version, users can’t alternate between themes, backup and restore data from Birthday Hub, sort all contacts by their <strong>Zodiac signs</strong>, etc.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>However, none of these features hinders the app’s functionality and can still be used as your go-to birthday reminder.</p><p><strong>Download: </strong><a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Birthday Hub</a></p><h2 id=remembering-birthdays-through-your-phone>Remembering Birthdays Through Your Phone</h2><p>Setting up birthday reminders on your Windows device is convenient but not always the best choice, especially if you don't fire up your laptop every day. Moreover, people do step outside without their Windows device, but rarely (if ever) without their phones. We usually have our cellphones with us at all times, making it a more practical alternative for birthday reminders.
