At Hogwarts Harry realises he's special and his adventures begin when he and his new friends Ron and Hermione attempt to unravel the mystery of the Philosopher's Stone.<br>I can read this book over and over again. From the very beginning until the end J.K. Rowling has me gripped! There is never a dull moment, whether it's battling with trolls, a three-headed dog, or Harry facing Lord Voldermort. I would definitely recommend this book because it keeps you reading without ever wanting to put the book down. By the end of the book you come to love the characters and you want to read more. You won't be disappointed because the second book in the series, Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets is just as great! If you haven't read any of the Harry Potter books you are missing out on the best series ever!</p><p class=dcr-epamsi><strong><span data-dcr-style=bullet></span> Buy this book at the <a href=# data-link-name="in body link">Guardian Bookshop</a></strong></p><p class=dcr-epamsi><strong>Want to tell the world about a book you've read? <a href=# data-link-name="in body link">Join the site</a> and send us your review!</strong></p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tbTEoKyaqpSerq96wqikaJuYnrmlvsSnqmaan6S4tHnSoqueZ2JlfnV7ya6laGpnZL%2BmwsiermaiXaB6s7vWpaCnn12drrO%2B2GanqKykmr9uvMeio6irn6W1pr7SZqqtp56a</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./best-underwear-for-menopause-156663.html><span>←</span><span>Best Underwear for Menopause</span></a>
