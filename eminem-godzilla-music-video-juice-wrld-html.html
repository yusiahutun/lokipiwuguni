We say that like it’s normal, but it actually is the most predictable thing to happen in this four-minute music video, directed by Cole Bennett from Lyrical Lemonade. Stuck in a Mad Libs world full of his clones, the rapper hunts himself down, killing different versions of himself in as many ways as possible until there is only one. He may be revisiting the past, but at least he didn’t bring a bunch of <a href=#>Eminems to the Oscars</a> this year, like he did for the <a href=#>2000 MTV VMAs</a>. We already had our hands full with <a href=#>Elsas</a>. For an emotional pivot, the “Godzilla” video is also dedicated to the late rapper Juice WRLD, who’s featured on the track. The 21-year-old, born Jarad Higgins, <a href=#>died of an accidental overdose</a> in December. “You will be here forever,” the video reads at the end, as a recording of Juice WRLD speaking plays. “Thank you for changing the wrld.”</p><h2 class=related-title data-editable=title>Related</h2><ul class=related-links data-editable=relatedItems><li class=related-link><span class=svg-wrapper></span><a href=# data-track-type=article-link data-track-component-name=related data-track-page-uri=www.vulture.com/_pages/cjb886oj400001zy6yws7z3u3@published data-track-headline data-track-component-title=Related><span class=headline>Eminem on His New Album, His Critics, and Hating Donald Trump</span></a></li></ul><span class=ambrose-short-hed>20 Years Later, Eminem Is Still Cloning Himself</span><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7t8HLrayrnV6YvK57kWlpaWdgaHymucinnKZll6Sxu7XLpZhmpaWotqR51aKbnqddn8Kqr8RmrquklGO1tbnL</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./379317-what-happened-shorty-iron-resurrection-html.html><span>←</span><span>What happened to Shorty from Iron Resurrection?
