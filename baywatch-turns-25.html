On September 22, 1989, the boob tube finally lived up to its name.
&#34;Baywatch&#34; landed on NBC on this date 25 years ago, bringing Pamela Anderson's bouncing body to the masses like never before, thanks to slow-mo runs down the beach and one of those famous red swimsuits.
While the show only lasted one season in primetime, David Hasselhoff pushed for a syndication deal which extended its run for another 10 seasons -- introducing the world to the hot bodies of David Chokachi, Gena Lee Nolin, Donna D'Errico, David Charvet and many, many more."><meta name=author content="Martina Birk"><link rel="preload stylesheet" as=style href=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/paper/css/app.css><link rel="preload stylesheet" as=style href=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/paper/css/an-old-hope.min.css><script defer src=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/paper/js/highlight.min.js onload=hljs.initHighlightingOnLoad()></script>

Later this week we'll post interviews with <strong>Nicole Eggert</strong>, <strong>Alexandra Paul</strong>, <strong>Kelly Packard</strong> and<strong> Jaason Simmons</strong>, who all spilled some great set stories.</p><p>But first, to kick things off, we're taking a dive into one of the cast's biggest mysteries: What happened to <strong>Yasmine Bleeth</strong>?</p><p>The gorgeous brunette was introduced on the show's fourth season as <strong>Caroline Holden</strong>, the sister of Alexandra's character, Stephanie. She quickly became one of the series' hottest commodities and was even named one of People Magazine's Most Beautiful.</p><img src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/images.toofab.com/image/fc/o/2014/09/19/fc319c7654625f54b22cb4c054c221f2_md.jpg style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center><p>She was let go from the series in 1997, with producer <strong>Doug Schwartz</strong> telling <a href=#><strong>Esquire</strong></a> that she was using drugs and "it was too difficult to deal with her after awhile." She would go on to appear on <strong>"Nash Bridges"</strong> and had a starring role on <strong>Aaron Spelling's</strong> short-lived primetime soap <strong>"Titans"</strong> in 2000 (above).</p><p>Later that year, she <span>checked herself into rehab at Promises in Malibu, where she met her future husband, <strong>Paul Cerrito</strong>. After her release, she was arrested after hitting a median in Detroit while high on cocaine and served two years probation for the offense (below).</span></p><img src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/images.toofab.com/image/99/o/2014/09/19/99e8d111fb625dff8ea102d2c4df741c_md.jpg style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center><p>Shortly after that, she appeared in the <strong>"Baywatch: Hawaiian Wedding"</strong> movie in 2003 ... and then did nothing else. While most of the cast pop up for random conventions and reunions, Bleeth has been MIA for the past 10 years -- with no public appearances or even paparazzi sightings.</p><p>The last photo of her was taken with her hubby at <strong>Carmen Electra</strong> and <strong>Dave Navarro's</strong> engagement party (!) in February 2003 (below).</p><img src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/images.toofab.com/image/bf/o/2014/09/19/bf25e926e42855559ed56abaef98343e_md.jpg style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center><p>Now 46, we're told Yasmine lives in Arizona with Paul and turns down all interviews related to her most famous role ... if not all interviews altogether.</p><p>Some people just want out of the spotlight. Yasmine is clearly <a href=#><strong>the Michael Schoeffling</strong></a> of "Baywatch."</p><p>Every day this week we'll be updating you on the lives of more "Baywatch" stars -- so keep checking back!</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmisn6Szoq6NnKamZ2JlfnV7j3Jma2pfl666w8CtmqFlpKq%2Fr7%2BMa2xo</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./outfits-meghan-markle-cant-wear-after-royal-wedding.html><span>←</span><span>Outfits Meghan Markle Can't Wear Now That She's Royal</span></a>
