Check out our <a href=#>product research & curation process</a><p>A dreamy stroll into the deep, enchanting woods with misty sunrays smoked in sweet resinous scent – this warm and intense fragrance is how the best oud perfumes make you feel. oud or oudh has ancient traces to its longstanding glory in the world of perfumery. This iconic scent is synonymous with Middle Eastern traditions, luxury, exclusivity, and sensuousness. The beguiling and exotic oudh has journeyed across the global perfume space to find its spot in the most pristine blends and premium bottles. The dark and sophisticated notes of this perfume are highly revered by both men and women. As per our expertise, in the following sections, we delve into the layers of oudh and take you through the best oud perfumes that you can have on your aromatic shelf.</p><p>Our top picks</p><p><h2 class=title>All About Oud Fragrance: What Is Oud And Where Is It Sourced From?</h2></p><p>Having an Oriental connotation to its glory, the oud or oudh is one of the most precious and rarest raw materials in the world. Also known as agarwood and ‘liquid gold’ the oud is produced when the aquilaria (or agarwood) tree, found in Assam, India, and Bangladesh is infected by a mold called phialophora parasitica. As a defense mechanism, it exudes a dense and resinous fragrant, which becomes the source of extracted oud. The age of the agar tree underlays the value of its oud — the older the better! Other essential aspects like the place of origin and whether it is naturally or synthetically infected also affect the aroma.&nbsp;</p><p>A staple in Indian, Middle-eastern, and Japanese olfactory traditions, the seductive, intense, and woody essence of oud has been around for centuries.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p>The complex tang of oud can be described as smoky wood, dampened in the warmth of resinous leather. The dark and intense aroma is potent in the initial notes and beautifully descends into the lingering accents, honeyed with richness.&nbsp;</p><p>With oud at their hearts, the exemplary fragrance houses have delivered the most exotic assortments with unforgettable palettes. Floral, citrussy, musky, vanilla glazed, and sensual burnt blends are a few warm and fuzzy notes to mention. Oud has its way to embrace the varying tastes of its connoisseurs.</p><p><h2 class=title>14 Best Oud Perfumes</h2></p><p>Luxe from the outside and divine from the inside.

Finally, the fusion is embraced in intense base notes by exotic benzoin, floral amber, and an intense combination of vanilla, nutty tonka bean, agarwood (oud), and spicy&nbsp;labdanum. This genderless fragrance is elegantly bottled and makes the chance of a sundowner finisher. The fuzziness can be carried with few spritzes to linger till the end of the night.

With dollops of buttery caramel, the opening notes nuzzle the fresh orange with tangy raspberries. The sugary punch flits into the sultry and nuanced underlay of violet, patchouli, roses, resinous olibanum, and sweet narcotic jasmine. The woody mid-tones are lifted by warm and cozy amber, musk, and sweet vanilla.

This determines if the perfume will be dark, intense, and musky, or mellowed down with fuzzing ingredients. For instance, oud and warm vanilla is a popular duo that enhances the sweetness of the fragrance. The candy-like, fruity, and floral accents make the oud scent engaging for formal to casual wear, or a daytime pick, especially during hotter months.&nbsp;</p><p>Whereas, when the oud is uplifted with a spicy scent and stronger notes, like pepper, it arouses a more earthy and sensuous aroma, perfect for evening wear, dinners, or night outs.&nbsp;</p><ul><li><strong>Based on How You Apply the Perfume</strong></li></ul><p>If you love showering yourself under the swirling spritzes of perfumes and lather up general dozes of sprays then you can choose a light-hearted oud, as it won’t be overpowering for others. On the other hand, if you prefer a minimal application that feels lightweight, a powerful scent is likely to fit the bill.</p><p>The application can also vary based on the aspects, like spots you may prefer to spritz on, or if it is a spray on your garments; these factors also affect how the scent comes off. If you sweat a lot you might want to pick a stronger fragrance or pair it with a carrier oil to last longer.</p><p>Talking about Oud perfumes, our contributor Viktorija Veltmane, a perfume enthusiast, says, “Oud, otherwise known as agarwood, is a complex fragrance that comes from the resinous heartwood of agarwood trees. The aroma is very rich, woody, and has a very pleasant combination of depth. Oud is ultimately used in many fragrances as a base note and may make the perfume light and airy if used together with citrus or floral accent, while might also make a strong, masculine combination if used together with leather, tobacco or patchouli.”</p><p><h2 class=title>How to Use Oud Perfumes?</h2></p><p>On the clean skin, begin by shaking the bottle, as it may be required for scents. Begin spritzing on your desired spots on the body. Some most common areas are your neck and wrist. Make sure you do not rub the perfume on the skin, as it may alter the scent significantly. You can also drizzle perfume in the air and walk into it for an airy, light application.</p><p>Thinking about oud perfumes makes one wander back to the mid-centuries and Arabian Bazaars.
