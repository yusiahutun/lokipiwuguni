Fortunately, there are many solutions to this problem.</p><strong class=ad-zone-advertising-tag></strong><h2 id=verify-discord-status>1. Verify Discord Status</h2><p>Before changing any settings on your computer, check if Discord servers are operational. Go to <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Discord Status</a> to see if there is a problem with the servers. Also, if you have a Twitter account, you can follow <strong>@<a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">discord</a></strong> for any updates.</p><p>If there are problems with Discord servers, there is nothing you can do except wait. If all Discord systems are operational, the problem might be on your end.</p><h2 id=run-discord-with-administrative-rights>2. Run Discord With Administrative Rights</h2><p>It’s possible that, under your specific combination of software and hardware, Discord needs administrative rights to operate successfully. To see if it resolves your issue, you can try running Discord with admin rights.</p><strong class=ad-zone-advertising-tag></strong><p>Go to the executable file's properties. There, you should see an option allowing you to run Discord with administrative rights. Once you've saved the new settings, launch Discord and check if this solution fixes the screen sharing issue.</p><p><span class=related-single>Related: <a href=#>Fixes to Try When Your Microphone Isn't Working on Discord</a></span></p><h2 id=exit-full-screen>3. Exit Full Screen</h2><p>If you are looking for a quick fix, try to play games or use your browser in a normal window. Using full-screen mode can lead to problems with Discord’s permissions which will affect the sharing feature.</p><strong class=ad-zone-advertising-tag></strong><h2 id=disable-the-latest-technology-setting>4. Disable the Latest Technology Setting</h2><p>There is a chance this Discord feature is causing your screen sharing issue. Follow these steps to turn it off:</p><li>In Discord, go to <strong>Settings</strong>.</li><li>Click <strong>Voice & Video</strong> under <strong>APP SETTINGS</strong> and scroll the main page down to the <strong>SCREEN SHARE</strong> section.</li><li>Turn off the toggle next to <strong>Use our latest technology to capture your screen</strong>.</li><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static1.makeuseofimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/latest-technology-1.png><h2 id=turn-off-hardware-acceleration>5. Turn Off Hardware Acceleration</h2><p>The hardware acceleration feature manages your system resources more efficiently. It reduces CPU usage by reassigning certain tasks to the graphics card. However, if you are using an older computer, hardware acceleration might stop the screen sharing feature from working properly.</p><strong class=ad-zone-advertising-tag></strong><p>Here is how you can turn it off:</p><li>In Discord, go to <strong>Settings</strong>.</li><li>From the <strong>APP SETTINGS</strong> list, select <strong>Voice & Video</strong>.</li><li>Turn off the toggle next to <strong>H.264 Hardware Acceleration</strong>.</li><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static1.makeuseofimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/hardware-acc-1.png><h2 id=add-your-game-to-discord-activity>6. Add Your Game to Discord Activity</h2><p>Usually, Discord has no problem detecting apps and games by itself, but sometimes it needs a little help. You can manually add your game or app to Discord to fix the problem.</p><li>Open Discord and go to <strong>Settings</strong>.</li><li>Under <strong>ACTIVITY SETTINGS</strong>, select <strong>Activity Status</strong>.</li><li>Click <strong>Add it!</strong>.</li><li>Extend the drop-down list and choose the game or app that you want to share.</li><li>Launch the game and test if you can now share the screen.</li><strong class=ad-zone-advertising-tag></strong> <img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static1.makeuseofimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/add-game-1.png><h2 id=update-the-app>7. Update the App</h2><p>Discord’s developers constantly release updates to fix bugs. If you can’t share your screen, there is a chance you need an update to fix this problem.</p><p>While the app should update automatically, you can search for updates manually. Maximize the app window and press <strong>Ctrl + R</strong> on Windows or <strong>Cmd + R</strong> on Mac. Discord will reload the interface and search for an update.</p><h2 id=delete-discord-cache-data>8. Delete Discord Cache Data</h2><p>Discord uses cache and roaming data to save your account settings and temporary data. This data is important as Discord uses it to provide a smooth user experience. However, if the cache data gets corrupted, it could stop the screen sharing feature from working properly. To fix it, you should delete Discord’s cache files.</p><p>Before deleting Discord cache data, make sure you've closed all of its running processes.</p><p><span class=related-single>Related: <a href=#>How to Clear Your Discord Cache to Free Up Wasted Space</a></span></p><h2 id=reinstall-discord>9. Reinstall Discord</h2><p>If you have tried anything on our list and nothing worked for you, a corrupt or damaged Discord file might cause you the issue. In this case, the best solution is to reinstall the app.</p><p>Once you’ve uninstalled the app, download it again from <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Discord’s website </a>and follow the on-screen instructions to complete the install.</p><strong class=ad-zone-advertising-tag></strong><h2 id=share-your-screen-with-no-problems>Share Your Screen With No Problems</h2><p>Discord is a growing community that could help you connect with people sharing the same interests and passions as you.
