For Kristy and Mike, a couple from Utah, watching&nbsp;</span><span data-preserver-spaces=true>Home Town</span><span data-preserver-spaces=true>&nbsp;gave them endless inspiration and made them want to visit the small town in Mississippi. After a busy season of work for Mike, a law firm owner, he and his wife booked a trip to Laurel to see if it was all they imagined.</span></p><p><span data-preserver-spaces=true>Mike said,&nbsp;</span><span data-preserver-spaces=true>"From the minute we arrived, we fell in love with everything about it. We loved the small-town feel and the vibe of the town. We walked around the historic downtown and neighborhoods and loved it. We hadn't expected to want to move there as much as we did."</span></p><p><img src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/cdn.shopify.com/s/files/1/1800/9573/files/Photo_Dec_14_12_55_53_PM.jpg alt style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto></p><p><span data-preserver-spaces=true>Kristy and Mike were instantly drawn to Laurel. Though it's different from their home in Utah, Laurel felt like a place they could settle into and find friends easily.</span></p><p><span data-preserver-spaces=true>He says,&nbsp;</span><span data-preserver-spaces=true>"People are great here in Utah, and we love our life here. Yet we had never met friendlier people than we met in Laurel. We were surprised at how open, warm, loving, and welcoming people were. There is something true to the old Southern hospitality mantra that you hear about it."</span></p><p><img src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/cdn.shopify.com/s/files/1/1800/9573/files/Photo_Dec_14_12_57_06_PM.jpg alt style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto></p><p><span data-preserver-spaces=true>The Ostermillers were utterly enamored with the idea of sharing life in Laurel along with their life in Utah. To their surprise, it wasn't that hard to convince themselves to apply for&nbsp;</span><span data-preserver-spaces=true>Home Town.</span></p><p><span data-preserver-spaces=true>Kristy said,&nbsp;</span><span data-preserver-spaces=true>"We just thought it would be awesome to just have a second home in Laurel as a vacation home for now. As life, work, and kids permit, we could start spending more of our time in the south. It's where we love to be!"</span></p><p><img src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/cdn.shopify.com/s/files/1/1800/9573/files/Photo_Dec_14_12_56_52_PM.jpg alt style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto></p><p>The Ostermillers have four children. Two of them are in their 20s and living independently, and two teenagers still live at home. While their lives are still set in the West, their hearts would adopt a second place to call home in a few short months.&nbsp;</p><p><span data-preserver-spaces=true>Buying a house from another state was challenging, but they trusted the&nbsp;</span><span data-preserver-spaces=true>Home Town</span><span data-preserver-spaces=true>&nbsp;team entirely to create a space their family would love.&nbsp;</span></p><p><span data-preserver-spaces=true>Kristy said,&nbsp;</span><span data-preserver-spaces=true>"They [Ben and Erin] are just as genuine in person as they are on the show. They made it easy, and the whole crew made effortless and not stressful. The whole process was just fun."</span></p><p><img src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/cdn.shopify.com/s/files/1/1800/9573/files/Photo_Dec_14_12_59_46_PM_1.jpg alt style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto></p><p><img src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/cdn.shopify.com/s/files/1/1800/9573/files/Photo_Dec_14_12_59_57_PM.jpg alt style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto></p><p><img src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/cdn.shopify.com/s/files/1/1800/9573/files/Photo_Dec_14_1_02_44_PM.jpg alt style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto></p><p><img src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/cdn.shopify.com/s/files/1/1800/9573/files/Photo_Dec_14_1_01_25_PM_1.jpg alt style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto></p><p><span data-preserver-spaces=true><img src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/cdn.shopify.com/s/files/1/1800/9573/files/Photo_Dec_14_1_03_16_PM.jpg alt style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto></span></p><p><span data-preserver-spaces=true>Over the next few months of renovation, the anticipation thickened, and they made their&nbsp;final trip as guests to Laurel for the reveal. From the moment they saw the home, the entire family was struck by the instant hospitality, warmth, and intentionality.</span></p><p><span data-preserver-spaces=true>Kristy said,&nbsp;"My favorite part of the renovation is the little reading area by the fireplace and the bookshelves. It's just charming and cozy, and it's a nice little space for us."</span></p><p><img src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/cdn.shopify.com/s/files/1/1800/9573/files/Photo_Dec_14_1_01_03_PM.jpg alt style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto></p><p><span data-preserver-spaces=true><img src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/cdn.shopify.com/s/files/1/1800/9573/files/Photo_Dec_14_12_57_39_PM.jpg alt style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto></span></p><p><span data-preserver-spaces=true><img src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/cdn.shopify.com/s/files/1/1800/9573/files/Photo_Dec_14_1_00_41_PM.jpg alt style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto></span></p><p><span data-preserver-spaces=true>Mike remarked,&nbsp;</span><span data-preserver-spaces=true>"When we first looked at the house, I loved the sunroom. We don't have anything like that in Utah because it's not very common. Now it's by far my favorite part of the house, and that's where I spend all my time when we're there. We love to watch a football game, work or read. I still think it's the coolest thing."</span></p><p><span data-preserver-spaces=true>Ben's signature build for the episode was something that Kristy and Mike's family will cherish forever.&nbsp;</span></p><p><img src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/cdn.shopify.com/s/files/1/1800/9573/files/Photo_Dec_14_12_58_14_PM.jpg alt style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto></p><p><img src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/cdn.shopify.com/s/files/1/1800/9573/files/Photo_Dec_14_12_58_24_PM_1.jpg alt style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto></p><p><span data-preserver-spaces=true>Kristy said,</span><span data-preserver-spaces=true>&nbsp;"Ben combined the idea of a gaming table and a barrister desk by using the original sunroom windows as a glass top with wooden dividers. So you can work on a puzzle or play a game, leave it in place, place the glass on with the divider on top, and use the table as a normal table. We sat around that table all week during Thanksgiving."</span></p><p><span data-preserver-spaces=true>Ben also transformed the mudroom by creating a bench with dividers and placing hooks on the wall. He wanted their mudroom to be functional and aesthetically pleasing to view from other parts of the house.</span></p><p><img src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/cdn.shopify.com/s/files/1/1800/9573/files/Photo_Dec_14_12_59_46_PM.jpg alt style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto></p><p><img src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/cdn.shopify.com/s/files/1/1800/9573/files/Photo_Dec_14_1_03_37_PM_1.jpg alt style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto></p><p>Since their reveal, the Ostermiller kids have visited Laurel and grown in love with the small town that captured their parents' hearts.</p><p><span data-preserver-spaces=true>Mike said,&nbsp;</span><span data-preserver-spaces=true>"Our son went for a walk early one morning, and he came back and said, Dad, I wondered if you were losing your mind when you bought a vacation home in Laurel. But this is a calming, peaceful place."</span></p><p><img src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/cdn.shopify.com/s/files/1/1800/9573/files/Photo_Dec_14_1_00_08_PM_1.jpg alt style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto></p><p><img src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/cdn.shopify.com/s/files/1/1800/9573/files/Photo_Dec_14_1_02_09_PM_1.jpg alt style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto></p><p><span data-preserver-spaces=true>He continued,&nbsp;</span><span data-preserver-spaces=true>"Our daughter loves the warmer weather compared to our weather in Utah, but mostly, I think they have grown to appreciate the feel of small-town life."</span></p><p><span data-preserver-spaces=true>Mike and Kristy have wasted no time getting involved in the community and partaking in localevents when they're in Laurel. Mike even won Annual Day in the Park 5K this past May.</span></p><p><span data-preserver-spaces=true>He had planned on casually running the race, but his daughter challenged him to win the grand prize of Chik-fil-a gift cards for a year. He says,&nbsp;</span><span data-preserver-spaces=true>"I didn't start the race wanting to win, but I'm highly motivated by trying to get my daughter, Sarah, to think I'm cool. So I just decided I'm going to win this thing."&nbsp;</span><span data-preserver-spaces=true>And he did! He has the trophy on the bookcase to prove it.&nbsp;</span></p><p><img src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/cdn.shopify.com/s/files/1/1800/9573/files/Photo_Dec_14_12_56_53_PM.jpg alt style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto></p><p><span data-preserver-spaces=true>It was a delight to watch Kristy and Mike plant roots in Laurel, and we're so excited to see how their family will treasure time in this new space&nbsp;together.
