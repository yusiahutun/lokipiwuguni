He instantly became a friend, dedicated co-worker, and role model to me. And has remained as such for 25 years.</p><p id=ejQ3CNfg2G data-wc=52>"As a friend, Danny has been nothing but a positive influence on me. He's an extraordinarily honest and intentional human being. Over 25 year relationship I don't ever recall him lying to me. He's taught me about being direct and confronting issues in life and relationships head-on, resolving them, and moving forward.&nbsp;</p><p id=eD5fdmtj56 data-wc=58>"Danny is a person that is consistently there for you when you need him. We've traveled around the world together, raised our daughters together, and shared countless family moments. Not only is he a good friend to me. I've witnessed him be a good friend to others and the kind of brother others would be lucky to have."</p><h4 class="relatedContentTitleClass_r14hzpr7 hm-heading">Related</h4><ul class=relatedContentListClass_ra09n5z><li class=relatedContentItemClass_r1rbqie4><a aria-label="Danny Masterson: All about his wife Bijou Phillips and famous siblings" class=hm-link href=# rel><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/images.hellomagazine.com/horizon/square/10193cacc36e-danny-christopher-alanna-jordan-masterson.jpg></a><h5 class="miniCardTitle_m1w18s13 hm-heading"><a aria-label="Danny Masterson: All about his wife Bijou Phillips and famous siblings" class="miniCardLink_m75k0hi hm-link" href=# rel>Danny Masterson: All about his wife Bijou Phillips and famous siblings</a></h5></li></ul><p id=eWIdmy-gP- data-wc=36>Ashton, in a conversation with earlier in February 2023, conveyed his hope for Danny’s innocence. He clarified: “I don’t want him to elude the law, but I wish for the truth to show he's innocent."</p><p id=ePd_lSPcbJ8 data-wc=37>Ashton was candid about his inability to judge Danny's guilt, remarking: “I can’t know… I’m not the judge, the jury, the DA, the victim, or the accused. I’m in no position to comment. I genuinely don’t know.”</p><p id=e-asWdNOU9n data-wc=24>But after Danny was found guilty,<strong>&nbsp;the father-of-two wrote a letter to the judge in the hopes of the judge choosing a lower sentencing.</strong></p><p id=etLhfQXHvhT data-wc=81>He continued: “While I’m aware that the judgement has been cast as guilty on two counts of rape by force and the victims have a great desire for justice, I hope that my testament to his character is taken into consideration in sentencing. I do not believe he is an ongoing harm to society and having his daughter raised without a present father would be a tertiary injustice in and of itself.

Ashton reminisced about how Danny, taking on a mentorship role, cautioned the youthful cast about the rarity of their newfound success, urging them not to squander it through reckless actions.</p><p id=elC0VGkG_w7 data-wc=37>Despite the gravity of the accusations which became public in 2017, their bond seems to have endured. After Danny's exit from the Netflix series The Ranch due to the charges, Ashton kept the lines of communication open.&nbsp;</p><p id=ekITNq94LbN data-wc=35>He expressed his empathy for those feeling violated but also noted the impact such allegations have on the accused and their families.
