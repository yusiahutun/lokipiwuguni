Only one—he is the American business executive and&nbsp;industrial engineer, Tim Cook.

However, he prefers to keep his personal life confined.</p><p>Read the full article to learn about the most asked questions about Tim's Cook&nbsp;sexuality, his coming out story, his boyfriend's queries, and his career & net worth in brief.&nbsp;</p><h2>How did Tim Cook Come Out as Gay?</h2><p>Back in 2008, Valleywag's editor Owen Thomas wrote a piece titled&nbsp;'Is Apple COO Tim Cook gay?' and speculated about the tech boss' sexuality, according to <a href=# rel="follow noopener">Pink News</a>. <span id=ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-183 class=ezoic-adpicker-ad></span></p><span class="ezoic-autoinsert-ad ezoic-mid_content"></span><p>Thomas had&nbsp;based the piece&nbsp;on the previous reporting of Adam Lashinsky in Fortune magazine about Cook, describing the top tec exec as a "rumormonger."</p><p>&nbsp;Thomas wrote,&nbsp;</p><p>When he isn’t working he tends to be in the gym, on a hiking trail, or riding his bike.” Come on. What is this — a Fortune profile, or a men-seeking-men personals ad in Craigslist?</p><span class="ezoic-autoinsert-video ezoic-mid_content"></span><p>In regards to his personal life, Lashinsky had described Cook as a lifelong bachelor who was&nbsp;“a blank slate” and “intensely private," according to<a href=# rel="nofollow noopener"> NeimanLab</a>.&nbsp; <span id=ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-629 class=ezoic-adpicker-ad></span></p><p>However, till 2011, no one had any substantiative facts to deem Cook as gay. That year, he was finally outed by Ryan Tate on Gawker in a piece titled, '<a href=# rel="nofollow noopener">Meet Apple's New Boss, The Most Powerful Gay Man in Silicon Valley</a>.'</p><span class="ezoic-autoinsert-ad ezoic-long_content"></span><p>In the piece, Tate wrote that "two well-placed sources" confirmed that Cook was gay and top Apple executives had said that they would support him if he outed himself.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p>In 2013, a CNBC anchor took Cook's name during an on-air discussion about gay CEOs.&nbsp; <span id=ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-185 class=ezoic-adpicker-ad></span></p><p>Later, Tim himself came&nbsp;out as gay writing in the magazine&nbsp;<a href=# rel="follow noopener">Bloomberg Businessweek</a> in October 2014, verifying the gay rumors about him for years.</p><p>He stated his sexuality was one of the 'greatest gifts God has given him.' He also vocally advocated in support of same-sex marriage.</p><span class="ezoic-autoinsert-ad ezoic-longer_content"></span><p>In addition, he linked his coming out to a bigger picture of helping others to come out. He wrote,&nbsp; <span id=ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-623 class=ezoic-adpicker-ad></span></p><span class="ezoic-autoinsert-video ezoic-long_content"></span><p>I don’t consider myself an activist, but I realize how much I’ve benefited from the sacrifice of others. So if hearing that the CEO of Apple is gay can help someone struggling to come to terms with who he or she is, or bring comfort to anyone who feels alone, or inspire people to insist on their equality, then it's worth the trade-off with my own privacy.</p><p><strong>Note: Gawker Media founder Nick Denton<a href=# rel="follow noopener"> shut down </a>the magazine in the same year amidst stagnant traffic, which came from the magazine's niche audience who were reading the gossip&nbsp;about the tech business and tech figures. Hence, Thomas'piece couldn't be traced.</strong></p><h2>Will Tim Cook ever Marry?&nbsp;</h2><p>Although Tim Cook has accepted his sexuality as gay, he is yet to unveil his decision to get married. Back in August 2015, the former CEO of Cisco, John Chambers asked him about his thoughts on getting married.</p><span class="ezoic-autoinsert-ad ezoic-longest_content"></span><p>In reply, Tim said that he couldn't talk about marriage much as it needs two partners to be in a relationship. <span id=ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-187 class=ezoic-adpicker-ad></span></p><span class="ezoic-autoinsert-video ezoic-longer_content"></span><h2>Does Tim Cook have a 'Husband' or a 'Boyfriend'?</h2><p>Cook doesn't have a marital partner or a boyfriend as he likes to keep his personal life private.&nbsp;</p><p>Till now, there have been any credible news reports regarding Cook dating anyone.&nbsp;</p><p>However, many gossip sites online have been stating that Cook once dated<a href=# rel="nofollow noopener"> once-Google executive Benjamin Ling</a>, who is the founder of Bling Capital. <span id=ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-188 class=ezoic-adpicker-ad></span></p><p>However, the claim doesn't seem to have any substantiative basis.</p><p>Ling name came into the mix after Ryan Tate reported on his piece on Gawker that their&nbsp;tech executive source revealed that Cook was into Asian guys and another tech observer joked that Cook would pair with Ling.&nbsp;</p><p>"[O]ur tech executive source claims Cook is into Asian guys, a tidbit that prompted another tech observer, with whom we shared the item, to propose some strategic matchmaking that would pair Cook with Google hotshot Ben Ling," Tate <a href=# rel="nofollow noopener">wrote</a>. <span id=ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-637 class=ezoic-adpicker-ad></span></p><p>Hence, it will be safe to say that Tim is either still in search of his perfect partner to establish a relationship amdist a busy career or he is hiding his relationship</p><span class="ezoic-autoinsert-ad ezoic-incontent_6"></span><h2>Tim Cook's Career in Brief</h2><p>The&nbsp;&nbsp;Alabama native is the&nbsp;Chief Executive Officer&nbsp;of a popular American multinational technology company&nbsp;Apple Inc.

He was promoted to lead operations in 2007 and was promoted to&nbsp;Chief Executive in 2009.</p><p>In 2011, he was appointed as the new Chief Executive Officer of Apple Inc. after Steve resigned and became the board's chairman.
