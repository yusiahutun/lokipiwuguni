But I knew where to find all sorts of fruit trees. I had the inspiration to live the days outside; to learn about and live in nature, and try to bring nature into every­day life. I now have 280 people working with me – gardeners, engineers, stone masons. We work as a big team to produce outdoor spaces.”</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src="https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.scmp.com/sites/default/files/styles/486w/public/images/methode/2016/08/04/606db33e-549f-11e6-98ca-49b1c9e3ed10_486x.JPG?itok=BHMSdj17"><p datatype="p" class="c3 e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31" id=U10569856696nYG data-qa=Component-Component><strong class="c5 css-1mniedq eq9i94316" id=U10569856696wAF data-qa=ContentSchemaRender-defaultRenderMapFunctions-Component-0>Tell us about your Beijing project.</strong> “It’s a multi-use development [that will open in stages, beginning this year]. It will have a museum of modern art, the new Bulgari hotel [scheduled for completion in summer 2017], and two office towers that will hold 10,000 people. There is an outdoor theatre and space for restaurants and shopping. We had to embrace the whole concept and connect it all using outdoor spaces. We are creating an intimate garden and a river with lotus flowers. We brought people from China to Switzerland to show them how to lay round stones. We have transplanted 46 trees from a nearby forest. The air will be filtered by the trees, and so be of better quality. That’s very important. When I was there recently, the pollution was so bad my eyes were burning.”</p><p datatype="p" class="c6 e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31" id=U10569856696qWB data-qa=Component-Component><strong class="c5 css-1mniedq eq9i94316" id=U105698566969jF data-qa=ContentSchemaRender-defaultRenderMapFunctions-Component-0>So you use plants that are local wherever you work?</strong> “We like to use plants that grow naturally. Sometimes it’s a big challenge. So we find out first what is growing nearby and then we decide on the design. Plants that are growing naturally usually don’t need a lot of water. If I see a tree nearby that I like, or a certain type of grass, I’ll use that for my design. It’s important to be responsible, given issues with drought. We don’t want to be silly and get big water tanks just to water plants. That doesn’t make sense.”</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src="https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.scmp.com/sites/default/files/styles/486w/public/images/methode/2016/08/04/5acf3d94-549f-11e6-98ca-49b1c9e3ed10_486x.JPG?itok=-AbcO5H5"><p datatype="p" class="c6 e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31" id=U10569856696vFF data-qa=Component-Component><strong class="c7 css-1mniedq eq9i94316" id=U10569856696D7B data-qa=ContentSchemaRender-defaultRenderMapFunctions-Component-0>What else are you working on?</strong> “Palazzo Del Sol, on Fisher Island, near Miami, is a big [luxury residential] project. Again, we are using as many native plants as possible, to make the place integrated. Fisher Island was built up in the 1980s, so we have a certain architecture to work with. We want to bring elements to refresh the area while keeping to the colonial style.”</p><p datatype="p" class="c6 e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31" id=U10569856696y7 data-qa=Component-Component><strong class="c9 css-1mniedq eq9i94316" id=U10569856696vYC data-qa=ContentSchemaRender-defaultRenderMapFunctions-Component-0><span class="c8 css-1mniedq eq9i9439" id=U105698566964PC data-qa=ContentSchemaRender-defaultRenderMapFunctions-Component-0>Is there a part of the world where you’d like to work?</span></strong> <span class="c10 css-1mniedq eq9i9439" id=U105698566962wD data-qa=ContentSchemaRender-defaultRenderMapFunctions-Component-2>“I’m keen to do something in Los Angeles. For me, it’s interesting working in different climates, from Russia to tropical countries. We’ve done schools, hospital gardens, private gardens, hotels, wineries. The key is simply to understand how to use what is already there.”</span></p><p datatype="p" class="c4 e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31" id=U10569856696SCD data-qa=Component-Component>&nbsp;</p><p datatype="p" class="c4 e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31" id=U10569856696pwB data-qa=Component-Component>&nbsp;</p><img aria-label=loading data-qa=BaseImage-handleRenderImage-StyledImage src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/assets-v2.i-scmp.com/production/_next/static/media/wheel-on-gray.af4a55f9.gif style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tK%2FMqWWcp51kuqKzwLOgp52jZL2wv9NmpJqfka%2B2r7GOnZysoZejeqq6056poqeiqHyivtOimqWdX2aGeoOVbGpopJ%2BYrq15z6WYp6yjYsCmr9Geq2akkaOxtK%2FAqZxmmaKYtarAxJyr</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./gypsy-roses-ex-husband-ryan-anderson-claims-ken-urkers-call-to-gypsys-step-mother-triggered-their-split-1296478.html><span>←</span><span>Gypsy Roses Ex-Husband Ryan Anderson Claims Ken Urkers Call To Gypsys Step Mother Triggered</span></a>
