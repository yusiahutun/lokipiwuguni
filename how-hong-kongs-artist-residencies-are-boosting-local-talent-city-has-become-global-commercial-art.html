He also says that being an artist in Hong Kong has never been easy.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">“It is both immeasurably fulfilling and incredibly difficult. At the beginning it’s always hard and support is key: emotionally, creatively and fiscally. The institutions, museums and galleries all have their part in supporting those that visit,” he says.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/cdn.i-scmp.com/sites/default/files/d8/images/canvas/2023/03/17/e18ba3ea-404b-43c5-ae6d-7fd9c593a897_f5659941.jpg>Over recent years, Hong Kong has grown to become one of the three main international art market hubs along with London and New York. The city’s growing interest in the arts has helped to stimulate the local art scene, with many Hong Kong galleries exhibiting the work of local artists. In comparison to other world cities, however, <a class="euc41pk0 e13op9j60 e1qbu6wp1 css-jgjyn2 ef1hf1w0" href=# data-qa=BaseLink-renderAnchor-StyledAnchor><span data-qa=Component-Text class="css-0 e1qbu6wp0">artists in Hong Kong</span></a> still have fewer opportunities and get less support. Their opportunities to interact or work with other artists from around the world are also more limited.<p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">In the last few years, artist residencies such as the one run by K11 Artus have been set up in Hong Kong to help address this. These residencies differ in scope and purpose, and range from being fully funded or self-paid (or some version in between).</p><figure data-qa=Component-StyledFigure class="css-1eav71q e1haapfp2">[Being an artist in Hong Kong] is both immeasurably fulfilling and incredibly difficultBrendan Fitzpatrick, artist</figure><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">Some offer artists access to a studio or facilities, or allow them to integrate into a network of other artists from which to draw inspiration or find artistic partners. Others merely provide a contemplative space, which for a defined period can be used to reflect, complete a project, or improve their skills.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">Until late last year, Tai Kwun in Central ran art residencies in the site’s historic former residential quarters, hosting artists, performers, curators, architects, researchers, writers and academics. The programme aimed to develop a network of artists and professionals, boost interdisciplinary collaboration and interaction with the public, and contribute to a flourishing art scene in Hong Kong.</p><h3 type=h3 data-qa=Component-Component class="e14khtrb0 css-17x7qa9 e793b7w1"><a class="link-text css-e0dnmk ef1hf1w0" href=# data-qa=BaseLink-renderAnchor-StyledAnchor><span data-qa=DigitalArchiveLink-Topic class="css-1wyvcgo e1b1x8aa3"></span><p><span data-qa=DigitalArchiveLink-Title class="css-i31uou e1b1x8aa1">How a new generation of art spaces rebuilt Hong Kong’s cultural landscape</span></p></a></h3><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">In-Situ also runs artist residencies in To Kwa Wan, although they are presently on pause since the Covid-19 pandemic. Founder John Lui, who is a former director at Red Gate Residency in Beijing, set up In-Situ in 2017, as he saw that, although Hong Kong is a commercial art hub with galleries, art fairs and auction houses, the city lacked an independent artist-run space.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">“Various artist-run galleries and residencies in the past have come and gone. It’s not easy to sustain such programmes in Hong Kong,” he says. “When I was looking at the art landscape in 2017, I felt there was a real need for an artist residency that was not by invitation only and instead had an open-call application where any artist at various stages of their artist career could apply. I wanted an artist to be judged only by whether they could take good advantage of their time in Hong Kong to create new and meaningful work, without being bound to preconceived proposals.”</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/cdn.i-scmp.com/sites/default/files/d8/images/canvas/2023/03/17/4850c508-7b54-48f9-b840-27a0d65f5024_3d9ba8af.jpg><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">In-Situ, which charges a participation fee, has hosted exhibitions of work by local and international artists, and Lui says his goal is to support artists inside and outside Hong Kong. For the artist residency, however, Lui decided to focus on international artists.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">“I think the artist residency model is a good vehicle for cultural exchange and a catalyst for new ways of thinking. Growing up, I have lived in different countries and after going to art university in the US, I attended different artist residencies and it really expanded my artistic practice and gave me access to different forms of artistic communities,” he says. “What excites me is sharing what Hong Kong has to offer.”</p><h3 type=h3 data-qa=Component-Component class="e14khtrb0 css-17x7qa9 e793b7w1"><a class="link-text css-e0dnmk ef1hf1w0" href=# data-qa=BaseLink-renderAnchor-StyledAnchor><span data-qa=DigitalArchiveLink-Topic class="css-1wyvcgo e1b1x8aa3"></span><p><span data-qa=DigitalArchiveLink-Title class="css-i31uou e1b1x8aa1">5 of the biggest travel trends for 2023, from off-peak to solo trips</span></p></a></h3><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">For Portuguese artist Ana Teresa Vicente, what Hong Kong has to offer is life-changing. She enrolled in In-Situ’s residency, with funding from Fundação Oriente, the Museum of the Orient in Lisbon, Portugal, from January to April 2020. She says the residency had a “huge impact, on a creative and personal level”. Her residency was significantly affected by the Covid-19 pandemic, nevertheless, she says achieved her goals.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">“The director of In-situ and I undertook a few field trips during the residency, while respecting all the safety measures imposed by the pandemic, that were incredibly valuable, including to Makerbay, a non-profit innovation makerspace based in Tsuen Wan, and to Sham Shui Po,” she says. “I collaborated with local researcher Maria Li Lok-yee and artist Cordelia Tam for my artwork, Transtopia. I’m very grateful to everyone who received me with open arms, and shared their knowledge, ideas and expertise.”</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/cdn.i-scmp.com/sites/default/files/d8/images/canvas/2023/03/17/5a81daff-fd1d-4ae9-9f86-7c346c2d761e_53933fe2.jpg><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">Hong Kong itself has had a lasting impact on her work as an artist.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">“The towering skyscrapers, with their impenetrable reflective surfaces and viciously over-lit environments, had a huge impact on me and my research,” she says. “Glass as a material, and the shape of secluded boxes, have become part of my work since then, as have dome-like structures to encase my work, pointing to a sense of spatial confinement of a fabricated condition, a devastated miniature world that echoes our environmental anxiety.”</p><figure data-qa=Component-StyledFigure class="css-1eav71q e1haapfp2">Various artist-run galleries and residencies in the past have come and gone.

Hongkongers have a strong entrepreneurial spirit, so even artists without gallery representation can grow their audience through social media and find creative ways to generate income,” he says.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">“Of course, there are challenges and the number of artists that could make a living making art full-time is quite limited, but seeing the creativity within emerging youth culture in Hong Kong keeps me optimistic,” he says.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tK%2FMqWWcp51kuqKzwLOgp52jZMC1xcueZqWdmajCs7GOmqmtoZOhsnB%2FkWpqcXBhZLWww4yhpqefXaC8r7PSZpirrJmowW6%2BxKygnZ2emLamv4yaqZ5lkqS8tMDIp55mpJ%2BYrq1505qjnqakYrCqwNhmn5qrXZeypLvMnmSgpJ%2BXrq15wqikpp2imLaiuIyaqa0%3D</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./does-honey-go-bad-it-could-in-the-wrong-conditions.html><span>←</span><span>Does Honey Go Bad?
