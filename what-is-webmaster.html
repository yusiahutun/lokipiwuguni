Several factors can affect a website and cause it to malfunction or break. It is also the webmaster's job to prevent this from happening.</p><p>A webmaster's job will vary depending on the size and nature of the website. Broadly speaking, a webmaster monitors the front-end and the back-end of a website.</p><p>In general, here's an insight into a typical day in the life of the average webmaster. Understanding this can help you decide whether a career as a webmaster is right for you or otherwise.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=a-typical-day-in-the-life-of-a-webmaster>A Typical Day in the Life of a Webmaster</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static1.makeuseofimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2022/02/Webmaster-typical-day.jpg><p>As a webmaster, your day will typically begin with the basics, checking to see that the front-end is working properly. You may also sort through your emails to see if there are any tickets requiring your attention.</p><p>Next up, is the back-end. You will need to log in to the site's back-end to see what's happening there. Are there plugins and themes that need to be updated? Do you need to update your CMS to the latest version?</p><p>Is there a comment on one of the blog posts that you need to screen and approve or decline? Is your SSL certificate up to date, or does your domain name registration need to be renewed?</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Your typical day as a webmaster may also involve writing reports and making presentations at management meetings to discuss the recent downtime, site user complaints, and the ways forward.</p><h2 id=job-description-for-a-webmaster>Job Description for a Webmaster</h2><p>As a webmaster, you are generally expected to take care of domain registration and management (.com or other TLD registration, WHOIS information, web hosting and renewals, SSL subscription).</p><p>As part of the role, you can also handle CMS installation and management, themes, backups, site maintenance/performance (speed and mobile responsiveness testing, troubleshooting, security, UX/UI/site (re)design, AB/Testing, Technical SEO, Server administration, browser/OS/device testing, site tracking and reporting, etc.).</p><p>Compliance is another key part of a webmaster's job. If you're managing an e-commerce website, or any site that accepts credit cards, for instance, you may be responsible for initiating, pursuing, or actualizing PCI compliance in line with PCI Security Council Standards for online merchants.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Additionally, you'll be required to troubleshoot any issues that may arise with the website, both at the front-end and back-end. In essence, you may double as the IT guy.</p><p>There's really no upper limit to what you can be required to do as a webmaster. You have the option of working at a 9 to 5 job doing all of these for a particular company, or starting an agency where you employ other webmasters to make your job easier.</p><p><span class=related-single>Related: <a href=#>How to Start Your Own Business While Working a Full-Time Job</a></span></p><h2 id=typical-job-requirements-for-a-webmaster-position>Typical Job Requirements for a Webmaster Position</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static1.makeuseofimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2022/02/Webmaster-requirements.jpg><p>Although being a webmaster primarily revolves around managing and maintaining websites, this role, like many others, is quickly evolving and involves a lot more work, especially in a 9 to 5 job.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>We did some digging and looked at some recent webmaster job descriptions.
