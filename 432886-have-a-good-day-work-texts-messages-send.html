Instead, get creative to avoid sending your man redundant messages. Send him <a href=# rel="nofollow noopener">love quotes </a>to put him in a good mood. He will undoubtedly have a good day after reading <a href=#>love quotes</a> on his phone. You can wish a good day to your boyfriend through these quotes:</p><ul><li>My wish is that you may be loved to the point of madness. - <i>André Breton</i></li><li>I love you not only for what you are but for what I am when I am with you. I love you not only for what you have made of yourself but for what you are making of me. I love you for the part of me that you bring out. - <i>Elizabeth Barrett Browning</i></li><li>Love is an untamed force. When we try to control it, it destroys us. When we try to imprison it, it enslaves us. When we try to understand it, it leaves us feeling lost and confused. - <i>Paulo Coelho</i></li><li>I saw that you were perfect, so I loved you. Then I saw that you were not perfect, and I loved you even more. - <i>Angelita Lim</i></li><li>If you live to a hundred, I want to live to a hundred minus one day, so I never have to live without you. - <i>Milne A A</i></li><li>I would rather spend one lifetime with you than face all the ages of this world alone. - <i>J R R Tolkien</i></li><li>The best love is the kind that awakens the soul; that makes us reach for more, that plants the fire in our hearts and brings peace to our minds. That’s what I hope to give you forever. - <i>Noah</i> from <i>The Notebook</i></li><li>If I know what love is, it is because of you. - <i>Hermann Hesse</i></li><li>I swear I couldn't love you more than I do now, yet I know I will tomorrow. - <i>Leo Christopher</i></li><li>You know you’re in love when you can’t fall asleep because reality is finally better than your dreams. - <i>Dr Seuss</i></li><li>Romance is the glamour that turns the dust of everyday life into a golden haze. - <i>Elinor Glyn</i></li><li>I love you as certain dark things are to be loved, in secret, between the shadow and the soul. - <i>Pablo Neruda</i></li><li>I love you without knowing how, when, or from where. I love you simply, without problems or pride: I love you in this way because I do not know any other way of loving but this, in which there is no I or you, so close that your hand upon my chest is my hand, so cherished that when I fall asleep your eyes close. - <i>Pablo Neruda</i></li><li>To be your friend was all I ever wanted; to be your lover was all I ever dreamed of. - <i>Valerie Lombardo</i></li><li>There is never a time or place for true love. It happens accidentally, in a heartbeat, in a single flashing, throbbing moment. - <i>Sarah Dessen</i></li></ul><a class=c-article-read-also__image-wrapper href=#><img sizes=256px style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/netstorage-tuko.akamaized.net/images/50bb2dbc1769d081.jpg></a><a class=c-article-read-also__headline href=# readability=27><p class=c-article-read-also__caption>Read also</p><p class=c-article-read-also__headline-wrapper><span class=c-article-read-also__headline-hover-inner>50+ sweet goodnight texts for her that'll make her feel loved</span></p></a><h3 id=432886-sweet-have-a-wonderful-day-messages-for-a-boyfriend class=table-of-contents__scroll-section>Sweet have a wonderful day messages for a boyfriend</h3><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/netstorage-tuko.akamaized.net/images/1cc410a582e4d365.jpg><p class=align-left>Be assured that your boyfriend loves your have a nice day at <a id=https://www.tuko.co.ke/facts-lifehacks/celebrity-biographies/432475-50-messages-a-gift-coworkers/ href=#>work text messages</a> even when he does not show it.
