Charles’ coronation took place on May 6 this year, almost exactly eight months after <a href=#>Queen Elizabeth</a> passed away at the age of 96.</p><figure class="wp-block-grvmedia-grv-video GRVMultiVideo"></figure><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/cdn1.celebritytidbit.com/uploads/39/2023/12/GettyImages-1487938949-1024x707.jpg><h2 class=wp-block-heading id=h-king-charles-jokes-about-his-sausage-fingers>King Charles jokes about his ‘sausage fingers’</h2><p>The <a href=#>TV</a> special, which will air on the BBC, sees the two royals practicing for the ceremony. William, 41, was filmed trying to do up the clasp of his dad’s very large and lavish robe.</p><p>Laughing, he quips: “On the day, that’s not going to go in,” and with a smile, his dad tells him: “No, you haven’t got sausage fingers like mine.”</p><p><strong>MORE:</strong> <a href=#>Prince William was ‘pressured’ to swallow his pride to text Harry, author says</a></p><p>The <a href=#>royals</a> can then be seen having an affectionate moment, with William kissing his dad on the cheek as the pair discuss how they will do it on the day. The sweet moment came as William prepared the moment he would pledge allegiance to his dad and the crown, but during rehearsals, Charles questioned his son.</p><p>After kissing him on the right cheek, William’s dad asked: “Wasn’t it that side?”</p><p>William obliges and then makes those around them laugh when he says: “Your left cheek is better” before stroking his dad’s face.</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading id=h-what-s-wrong-with-the-king-s-fingers>What’s wrong with the King’s fingers?</h2><p>Charles, 75, doesn’t just have larger-than-average finger sizes. King Charles suffers from a condition called Dactylitis, which is informally known as “sausage fingers.”</p><p><a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">According to</a> Healthline, the condition happens “due to inflammation known as&nbsp;tenosynovitis. This means that, unlike typical&nbsp;joint swelling&nbsp;that only affects the knuckle of a finger or toe, dactylitis&nbsp;causes inflammation of your entire finger or toe.”</p><p>The website explains a person’s fingers can become “so rigid that you can no longer make a fist.”</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading id=h-charles-may-leave-the-throne-for-william-to-be-king>Charles ‘may leave’ the throne for William to be king</h2><p>During the documentary in which King Charles talked about his “sausage finger,” Dean of Westminster, Dr David Hoyle wondered: “What is it like for him to watch this happen? He has to be aware that there will come a day when he too will be thinking about facing this challenge.” A royal columnist and author has claimed we could find out sooner rather than later.</p><p>Clive Irving previously claimed <a href=#>the King will abdicate</a> “within the next five years” to make way for William and <a href=#>Kate Middleton</a>. This would mean if he stepped down then, he would be 80 years old.</p><p>“It may have already been surreptitiously planned that the King will abdicate when he’s 80. He [Charles] wants to just have his moment in the limelight for a few years.” However, he suggested there could be another reason.</p><p>He continued his taking to the throne for several years could be due to “an incredibly difficult transitional phase” and said he wanted to be there for his eldest as well as his youngest, Prince William.</p><p>He concluded, saying Charles and <a href=#>Camila</a> could move to Balmoral in Scotland to enjoy retirement.</p><p><strong>MORE:</strong> <a href=#>King Charles’ Christmas dinner menu was changed after royal ‘choked’ at the table</a></p><p>Related Topics</p><p>MORE CELEBRITY STORIES</p><span></span><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7pLHLnpmroaSuwaqwwaKrZ5ufonxzfJFsZmpqX2d%2FcLfIp55mm5iWv62x0mahqKOVqHqirs6uq2agmah6tK3UrJignV2btq%2BzxKuqZq%2BZqbVuvNGipZydXay2rbjImqRmoZ5iu6bDjJyjoqhf</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./at-the-movies-origin-and-godzilla-minus-one.html><span>←</span><span>At the Movies | Origin and Godzilla Minus One</span></a>
