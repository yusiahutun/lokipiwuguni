Since 2020, preppy style has been reintroduced to the zeitgeist. Over time, it has continued to evolve and remains a staple in many of our wardrobes. The key to tenniscore? Tennis skirts, of course. Even if you’ve never picked up a racket, the classic tennis skirt is a stylish look from the court to the coffee shop.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-1 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--instyle commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html">“The number one thing to finding a good tennis skirt is paying attention to the waistband and making sure the silhouette of the skirt matches with your body,” says style blogger Akia Danielle.&nbsp;</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-2 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--instyle commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html">When choosing our favorites, we stuck with technical skirts, meaning they were designed for tennis or some kind of athletic activity, but can also be styled to wear casually.</p><span class=heading-toc id=toc-best-overall-nikecourt-dri-fit-victory-womens-flouncy-tennis-skirt></span><p><h2><span class=product-record__superlative-text>Best Overall</span></h2></p><p><h3><span class=product-record__heading--text>NikeCourt Dri-Fit Victory Tennis Skirt</span></h3></p><img width=1500 height=1000 data-sizes=750px alt="NikeCourt Dri-Fit Victory Women's Flouncy Tennis Skirt" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center src="https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.instyle.com/thmb/aeL9eirDDjSc3Pq2VfPVENKKAq8=/fit-in/1500x1000/filters:no_upscale():max_bytes(150000):strip_icc()/NikeCourt-Dri-Fit-Victory-Womens-Flouncy-Tennis-Skirt-3045e04a3dad4107b371609852f7697b.jpg"> <span class=figure-article-caption-owner><p>Nike</p></span><p><strong>What We Love: </strong>While the regular size range is pretty expansive, Nike also offers this skirt in <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=externalLink data-ordinal=1 rel="sponsored nofollow noskim">plus-sizes</a>.</p><p><strong>What We Don’t Love: </strong>The built-in undershorts sometimes peek through from under the skirt.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-2 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--instyle commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html">We’ll admit there’s no such thing as the perfect tennis skirt, but the NikeCourt Dri-Fit Victory Skirt comes close, thanks to its sustainable makeup, fair price, versatility, and (our favorite aspect) the inclusive sizing.&nbsp;</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-3 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--instyle commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html">Made from over 75 percent recycled polyester, the light and breezy fabric is supremely stretchy and features Nike’s signature Dri-Fit technology that wicks sweat away. Whether you’re serving on the court or strolling around town, you’ll be able to move freely because of the skirt’s technical design. The single pleat in the front creates additional space for your legs (and offers a more traditional tennis look), while the built-in shorts provide ample coverage and slight compression. Plus, you can even securely store a ball or two beneath the hem. And while the shorts do run a bit long (they can sometimes show from under the skirt), we don’t think it affects the overall sporty look.&nbsp;</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-4 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--instyle commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html"><strong>Size: </strong>XS–2XL<strong> | Material: </strong>Recycled polyester<strong> | Colors:&nbsp;</strong>4</p><span class=heading-toc id=toc-best-budget-fulbelle-tennis-skirt></span><p><h2><span class=product-record__superlative-text>Best Budget</span></h2></p><p><h3><span class=product-record__heading--text>Fulbelle Tennis Skirt</span></h3></p><img width=1500 height=1000 data-sizes=750px alt="Amazon Fulbelle Tennis Skirt for Women" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center src="https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.instyle.com/thmb/oe0xJMmNO1i0VJHByczY8xh4GdY=/fit-in/1500x1000/filters:no_upscale():max_bytes(150000):strip_icc()/Fulbelle-Tennis-Skirt-for-Women-b0220eb62b9b4901a1b5caf072d64194.jpg"> <span class=figure-article-caption-owner><p>Amazon</p></span><p><strong>What We Love: </strong>While many tennis skirts have a pocket along the inner shorts, this one also has two on the outer skirt layer, perfect for storing your phone and wallet.</p><p><strong>What We Don’t Love: </strong>The fabric is very thin, and if you select a lighter color, it can look slightly see through.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-7 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--instyle commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html">The tenniscore trend shows no signs of slowing down, but if you’re still unsure whether or not you fully want to lean into the aesthetic, it’s better to ease into the style with an affordable item. At less than $30, this pick from Fulbelle doesn’t skimp on quality or style. In fact, it has several exceptional features that skirts triple the price don’t have. Namely, the addition of pockets on the outer skirt.&nbsp;</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-8 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--instyle commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html">It’s very common for tennis skirts to have a stretchy compartment sewn into the undershorts, but because this style has pockets located on the outer layer, you can easily reach your phone or wallet. (And you could even store a ball or two if need be.)&nbsp;</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-9 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--instyle commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html">Pockets aside, we also appreciate that the wide waistband includes a hidden inner drawcord to customize the fit for your body. And you won’t catch yourself adjusting the shorts either — the silicone strips sewn into the hem prevent rolling.&nbsp;</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-10 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--instyle commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html">Looks-wise, the skirt comes in both solid colors and playful patterns for those who like to make a statement. But be aware that when you select a lighter hue, including white, the undershorts can look slightly see through, so plan your undergarments accordingly.&nbsp;</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-11 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--instyle commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html"><strong>Size: </strong>S–2XL<strong> | Material: </strong>Polyester, spandex<strong> | Colors: </strong>12</p><span class=heading-toc id=toc-best-splurge-tory-burch-pleated-laser-cut-tennis-skirt></span><p><h2><span class=product-record__superlative-text>Best Splurge</span></h2></p><p><h3><span class=product-record__heading--text>Tory Burch Pleated Laser Cut Tennis Skirt</span></h3></p><img width=1500 height=1000 data-sizes=750px alt="Shopbop Tory Burch Pleated Laser Cut Tennis Skirt" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center src="https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.instyle.com/thmb/Aggdc3alo8wJnShI_1CI-0mp9W8=/fit-in/1500x1000/filters:no_upscale():max_bytes(150000):strip_icc()/Tory-Burch-Pleated-Laser-Cut-Tennis-Skirt-12afa1e36a76460c89a12a8c15023e27.jpg"> <span class=figure-article-caption-owner><p>Shopbop</p></span><p><strong>What We Love: </strong>The laser-cut flower motifs and striped waistband elevate the conventional look of this skirt.&nbsp;</p><p><strong>What We Don’t Love: </strong>It’s only available in one colorway.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-14 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--instyle commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html">When you’re heading directly from the court to brunch, you need a tennis skirt that is both stylish and functional. Luckily, this flirty and feminine option from Tory Burch looks more elegant than your traditional options, yet still provides professional level performance.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-15 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--instyle commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html">Of course, the sophisticated design details are what initially caught our eye: A dainty, laser-cut flower pattern covers the skirt, something we haven’t seen in any other items. The striped elastic waistband ties the entire style together by amping up the preppy factor. Don’t let the delicate features fool you, though — this was made for actually playing tennis.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-16 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--instyle commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html">Made with four-way stretch fabric, the skirt moves with you as you race to hit the ball. This material also wicks away sweat and odor, so you’ll still feel fresh while you recharge post-match. Hidden underneath the pleated skirt, you’ll find built-in boy shorts with a large pocket for storing extra tennis balls.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-17 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--instyle commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html">Truthfully, there’s not much we’d change about the skirt. We simply wish there were more color options available. Right now, it’s only offered in classic white.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-18 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--instyle commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html"><strong>Size: </strong>XS–XL<strong> | Material: </strong>Polyester, elastane<strong> | Colors:&nbsp;</strong>1</p><span class=heading-toc id=toc-best-plus-size-spanx-get-moving-skort></span><p><h2><span class=product-record__superlative-text>Best Plus-Size</span></h2></p><p><h3><span class=product-record__heading--text>Spanx Get Moving Skort</span></h3></p><img width=1500 height=1000 data-sizes=750px alt="Nordstrom Spanx The Get Moving Skort" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center src="https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.instyle.com/thmb/hNGTBodwfZ1G6FzqMf9jL_uk_Vo=/fit-in/1500x1000/filters:no_upscale():max_bytes(150000):strip_icc()/spanx-The-Get-Moving-Skort-f81f403c609e4b0e8a042c707e0f2379.jpg"> <span class=figure-article-caption-owner><p>Nordstrom</p></span><p><strong>What We Love: </strong>The perforated side offers more wiggle room and provides easy access to the pocket.</p><p><strong>What We Don’t Love: </strong>If you plan on wearing this while playing tennis, the pocket placement is rather annoying.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-21 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--instyle commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html"><a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=internalLink data-ordinal=1>We can always count on Spanx</a> to create size inclusive staples.

Along the right side of the curve-hugging shorts is a handy stretch pocket that easily stores phones and credit cards. We also appreciate that you don’t have to hike up the skirt to reach it. Instead (and unlike the pockets on other options) it’s perforated like a curtain, creating a quick peek-a-boo moment and allowing for more space.&nbsp;</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-23 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--instyle commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html">However, this stretchy pocket is located on the right side of the garment, meaning that if you’re left handed, you might find this location rather challenging.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-24 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--instyle commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html"><strong>Size: </strong>XS–3XL<strong> | Material: </strong>Nylon, elastane, polyester<strong> | Colors:&nbsp;</strong>3</p><span class=heading-toc id=toc-best-with-pockets-love-bonito-cheak-courtside-skirt></span><p><h2><span class=product-record__superlative-text>Best with Pockets</span></h2></p><p><h3><span class=product-record__heading--text>Love Bonito cheak Courtside Skirt</span></h3></p><img width=1500 height=1000 data-sizes=750px alt="Love Bonito cheak Courtside Skirt" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center src="https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.instyle.com/thmb/EkdRiHoWG8_gv_VSXGdMpujM5lQ=/fit-in/1500x1000/filters:no_upscale():max_bytes(150000):strip_icc()/Love-Bonito-cheak-Courtside-Skirt-d141511a2ab34a8190517bc80631f4fb.jpg"> <span class=figure-article-caption-owner><p>Love Bonito</p></span><p><strong>What We Love: </strong>This skirt strikes a perfect balance between fashionable and practical.&nbsp;</p><p><strong>What We Don’t Love: </strong>It only has one pocket.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-27 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--instyle commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html">Part of what makes tennis skirts so appealing are their flirty and feminine silhouettes, but looks will only get you so far on the court. “Most tennis skirts are just riding trends. This non-pleated option is both cute and functional,” says InStyle commerce writer, Bianca Kratky. “While I have plenty of tennis skirts, this is the only one I actually play tennis in. It has a side pocket that’s a necessity for storing tennis balls.”</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-28 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--instyle commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html">Along with the utilitarian pocket, the front slit allows for quick movement, so you can freely dash after rogue balls. The skirt comes in basic white and black, and if you really want to feel like a champion, we suggest pairing it with the brand’s matching <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=externalLink data-ordinal=1 rel="nofollow nocaes">Polo Bra</a> for a cohesive look.&nbsp;</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-29 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--instyle commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html"><strong>Size: </strong>XXS–2XL<strong> | Material: </strong>Polyester, spandex, nylon<strong> | Colors:&nbsp;</strong>2</p><span class=heading-toc id=toc-best-on-amazon-zuty-high-waisted-tennis-skirt></span><p><h2><span class=product-record__superlative-text>Best on Amazon</span></h2></p><p><h3><span class=product-record__heading--text>ZUTY High-Waisted Tennis Skirt</span></h3></p><img width=1500 height=1000 data-sizes=750px alt="Amazon ZUTY 18&amp;quot; High Waisted Tennis Skirt" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center src="https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.instyle.com/thmb/0FcGWQHD92W_Ygs8qHvsmFGEgRk=/fit-in/1500x1000/filters:no_upscale():max_bytes(150000):strip_icc()/ZUTY-18-High-Waisted-Tennis-Skirt-82511560a95a4a3ea74778c5afd36320.jpg"> <span class=figure-article-caption-owner><p>Amazon</p></span><p><strong>What We Love: </strong>There are four convenient pockets sewn into the skirt.</p><p><strong>What We Don’t Love: </strong>This runs slightly big, so it’s best to size down.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-32 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--instyle commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html">We always rely on Amazon for affordable, trendy fashion. And when it comes to tennis skirts, few compare to the quality or design of this style. Coming in at 18-inches long, it's a more modest option than others, especially for anyone on the taller side or those who prefer not to show much skin. The high-rise fit offers extra coverage, too, landing right along the natural waistline to gently sculpt the midsection.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-33 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--instyle commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html">When it comes to pockets, this design has plenty: There are two stretchy compartments on the sides, one zippered pocket in the back, and a slim, hidden waistband pouch to throw your keys or cash.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-34 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--instyle commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html">Despite being made with stretchy fabric and an adjustable drawstring, this runs a bit big.

And after winning seven Grand Slam tournaments, she set her racket aside and founded her own activewear line, Eleven by Venus Williams. We love almost everything from her fashion-forward tennis and athleisure collections, but this matching set with coral stripes caught our eye.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-39 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--instyle commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html">Not only do the coral hues bring us joy, but the skirt is also built with every technical detail we could ever want. The hidden shorts, which also don the striped pattern, have handy pockets for storing extra tennis balls, while the soft elasticized waistband sits firmly along the midsection without prodding or digging, and moisture-wicking fabric keeps the body dry.

However, since this design from Wilson is a skort, you’ll find a traditional pleated mock-skirt in the front and shorts on full display in the back. This spunky style is a fresh and fun take on the classic pleated skirt that also allows for increased mobility.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-44 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--instyle commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html">The four-way stretch fabric also enhances movement (it won’t hold you back or slow you down), yet it maintains its shape and structure, even after dozens of washes. One of the only downsides to a pleated skirt is when it gets wrinkled — the zigzag crinkles ensure the pleats never look as crisp and smooth as they did before. But to our great surprise (and delight), the wrinkles in this skirt flatten as soon as it’s pulled on — no steaming required.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-45 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--instyle commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html"><strong>Size: </strong>XS–XL<strong> | Material: </strong>Nylon, spandex<strong> | Colors:&nbsp;</strong>3</p><span class=heading-toc id=toc-best-sculpting-halara-everyday-cloudful-air-fabric-2-in-1-skirt></span><p><h2><span class=product-record__superlative-text>Best Sculpting</span></h2></p><p><h3><span class=product-record__heading--text>HALARA Everyday Cloudful Air-Fabric 2-in-1 Skirt</span></h3></p><img width=1500 height=1000 data-sizes=750px alt="HALARA Everyday Cloudful&amp;Acirc;&amp;reg; Air 2-in-1 Tennis Skirt-Marvelous" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center src="https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.instyle.com/thmb/_YuZWN9DrZuec4_ybHYcRuT30ow=/fit-in/1500x1000/filters:no_upscale():max_bytes(150000):strip_icc()/halara-everyday-cloudful-air-2-in-1-tennis-skirt-marvelous-f7d4e490817740c69f3183aef4c3474a.jpg"> <span class=figure-article-caption-owner><p>Halara</p></span><p><strong>What We Love: </strong>Halara’s signature Cloudful Air fabric was designed to keep you cool and comfortable in hot, muggy conditions.&nbsp;</p><p><strong>What We Don’t Love: </strong>The skirt is quite short, and it’s not available in more than one universal length, which may not work for taller figures.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-48 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--instyle commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html">One of TikTok’s favorite up and coming fashion brands, Halara, has rightfully put the affordable brand on the cultural radar.

Instead, it stays firmly along the waistline, even through vigorous matches. As a bonus, the super sweat-wicking material makes this skirt an especially terrific option on humid days (in fact, we sometimes wear it on the golf course in the blistering sun).</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-50 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--instyle commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html">While the high-rise provides more than enough coverage, the skirt length is short, skimming the top of the thighs.

The key is leaning into styles with forgiving fabrics and design elements that provide more space, like higher slits. We were thrilled to find that the Court Skort from Outdoor Voices is made with thoughtful, size inclusive features, including a figure flattering A-line silhouette that works well with all body shapes and sizes.&nbsp;</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-55 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--instyle commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html">We also value that the interior shorts are longer than most options on our list, extending almost to the bottom of the skirt. Although without any added grip sewn into the hem, the shorts tend to ride up, but they should stay in place for low impact activities, like walking.&nbsp;</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-56 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--instyle commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html"><strong>Size: </strong>XXS–3XL<strong> | Material: </strong>Polyester, spandex<strong> | Colors:&nbsp;</strong>4</p><span class=heading-toc id=toc-best-classic-alo-yoga-varsity-tennis-skirt></span><p><h2><span class=product-record__superlative-text>Best Classic</span></h2></p><p><h3><span class=product-record__heading--text>Alo Yoga Varsity Tennis Skirt</span></h3></p><img width=1500 height=1000 data-sizes=750px alt="Nordstrom Alo Varsity Tennis Skirt" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center src="https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.instyle.com/thmb/alfj-fxRngigROaYg1nPIBsCyB0=/fit-in/1500x1000/filters:no_upscale():max_bytes(150000):strip_icc()/Alo-Varsity-Tennis-Skirt-4949c7adb84948a8bac190240d15d747.jpg"> <span class=figure-article-caption-owner><p>Nordstrom</p></span><p><strong>What We Love: </strong>This sweat-wicking, compressive skort is made from recycled water bottles.</p><p><strong>What We Don’t Love: </strong>The built-in shorts run tight and those with thicker legs may want to size up for a more comfortable fit.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-59 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--instyle commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html">We love that brands are constantly reinventing the tennis skirt, but there’s something so quintessential about a preppy pleated silhouette in white. <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=internalLink data-ordinal=1>Alo Yoga</a> may not have created the original, but their iteration stands the test of time.&nbsp;</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-60 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--instyle commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html">The mid-rise skirt hits right around the mid-thigh (although higher on taller frames), while the hidden shorts underneath comfortably cover your bottom.

And since the shorts are just as thick as the skirt, they look opaque while worn — except for the white hue. We discovered they’re slightly see-through as they stretch to fit the leg, but it’s not so noticeable that it stops us from wearing them.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-62 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--instyle commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html"><strong>Size: </strong>XXS–L<strong> | Material: </strong>Nylon, spandex<strong> | Colors:&nbsp;</strong>5</p><span class=heading-toc id=toc-best-sustainable-girlfriend-collective-sport-skort></span><p><h2><span class=product-record__superlative-text>Best Sustainable</span></h2></p><p><h3><span class=product-record__heading--text>Girlfriend Collective Sport Skort</span></h3></p><img width=1500 height=1000 data-sizes=750px alt="Girlfriend Collective Sport Skort" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center src="https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.instyle.com/thmb/K0mYlbxDeKESguO7WKsRyayp4uU=/fit-in/1500x1000/filters:no_upscale():max_bytes(150000):strip_icc()/girlfriend-collective-sport-skort-ba312627ea014c7cace081681c4ac8b7.jpg"> <span class=figure-article-caption-owner><p>Girlfriend Collective</p></span><p><strong>What We Love: </strong>The sweat-wicking, quick-drying fabric ensures the skirt never feels damp, even through intense sweat sessions.&nbsp;</p><p><strong>What We Don’t Love: </strong>The shorts are long — if you don’t want them to show you may need to bunch them up.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-65 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--instyle commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html">If shopping ethically is important to you (it should be), this sporty skort from Girlfriend Collective needs to be on your radar. We were impressed to learn that the green fabric is constructed from recycled water bottles. In this garment, it’s blended with a touch of spandex, which body-positive fashion creator Nikki Apostoulou says helps to gently sculpt and support the body (especially the midsection).&nbsp;</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-66 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--instyle commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html">While the compression alone makes this a great choice for leisurely activities, the material is also sweat-wicking for easy wear during aerobics classes and pickleball tournaments alike.&nbsp;</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-67 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--instyle commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html">The design of the skort is much more form-fitting than other options on our list, and we’ll admit that the undershorts can feel a tad snug.

InStyle’s senior commerce editor <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=internalLink data-ordinal=1>Shannon Bauer</a> fell in love with the style from the moment she slipped it on, and after experiencing how it performed through a sweaty game of tennis, she decided to purchase another color.&nbsp;</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-72 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--instyle commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html">“I’m completely obsessed with the fit and design,” she says. “The back pleats give the skirt a sleeker shape and cut down on bulk, while the elastic strips on the bottom of the shorts keep them from sliding around or riding up.”</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-73 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--instyle commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html">Along with the unique features that keep this in Bauer’s summer rotation, the sweat-wicking capabilities boost the skirt’s overall athletic appeal. Aside from pulling moisture to the surface, the fabric is also quick-drying and breathable, so you can stay cool, calm, and collected, even during intense matches. And, as a bonus, the material offers UPF 50+ to protect your skin from the sun. (UPF indicates how many UVB and UVA rays penetrate your skin and a UPF fabric blocks 98 percent of sun exposure, significantly reducing your risk of skin damage.)</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-74 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--instyle commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html">Overall, Bauer only notes one minor con.<strong> </strong>“I do find the shorts a little too long for the length of the skirt,” she says. Her quick-fix solution? She bunches them up so they stay hidden.&nbsp;</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-75 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--instyle commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html"><strong>Size: </strong>XXS–3XL<strong> | Material: </strong>Polyester, spandex<strong> | Colors:&nbsp;</strong>3</p><span class=heading-toc id=toc-best-long-length-lululemon-court-rival-high-rise-skirt></span><p><h2><span class=product-record__superlative-text>Best Long Length</span></h2></p><p><h3><span class=product-record__heading--text>Lululemon Court Rival High-Rise Skirt</span></h3></p><img width=1500 height=1000 data-sizes=750px alt="lululemon Court Rival High-Rise Skirt" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center src="https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.instyle.com/thmb/HQWLvtmygz5PARKyObt6-wN1I-I=/fit-in/1500x1000/filters:no_upscale():max_bytes(150000):strip_icc()/lululemon-court-rival-high-rise-skirt--5b487ce8cda14825969f1d7a57907bde.jpg"> <span class=figure-article-caption-owner><p>lululemon&nbsp;</p></span><p><strong>What We Love: </strong>Lululemon gives you the option to choose between two lengths — the standard 15-inch and more conservative 17-inches.</p><p><strong>What We Don’t Love: </strong>This skirt is made with a lot of fabric, so it can look a bit overwhelming on shorter folks.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-78 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--instyle commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html">Mini skirts are currently in style, so we’re not surprised that many tennis skirts now sport shorter hemlines.

InStyle writer Irene Richardson thinks the less traditional design makes the skirt standout. “Unlike classic tennis skirts that feature pleats, this one has several asymmetrical tiers of lightweight fabric that look more interesting,” she says. “I feel like a flirty goddess when I romp around the city in this.”</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-80 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--instyle commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html">Richardson thinks the longer length and flouncy fit accentuate her taller frame (she’s five-foot-seven), but those characteristics can drown out petite frames.

One company’s material may feel thick and weighty, while another may be airy and lightweight. “It's definitely worth investing in a quality, thicker fabric,” says California-based personal stylist Sahra Schukraft Brandt. A heavier textile also tends to be more durable as well as opaque, so you won’t have any wardrobe malfunctions while out and about.</p><h3 id=mntl-sc-block_3-0-4 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-subheading--instyle commerce-sc-block-subheading--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-subheading mntl-sc-block-subheading"><span class=mntl-sc-block-subheading__text>Style</span></h3><p id=mntl-sc-block_3-0-5 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--instyle commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html">The biggest question when it comes to tennis skirts or <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=internalLink data-ordinal=1>sporty skorts</a> is whether you want a pleated or straight design.
