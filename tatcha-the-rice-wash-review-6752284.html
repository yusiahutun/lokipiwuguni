My logic was always that if the active ingredients aren't staying on my skin long enough to do something, it wasn't worth giving it too much thought — all I needed was for the formula to cleanse my skin without irritating it.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_3-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">However, trying <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=externalLink data-ordinal=1 rel=nofollow>Tatcha's The Rice Wash</a> soft cream cleanser, I had eat my own words.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_5-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">Until I tried this cult-favorite J-beauty product, cleansing felt like a task. It's something I had to do in the evening to wash away the day's sweat, makeup, and more. My mind changed instantly as I gently rubbed this cleanser into my face. The subtle Japanese rice powder softly buffed away any impurities on my skin as it mixed with my warm shower water to create a frothy lather.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_9-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">Afterwards, instead of feeling like a chore and something I gave into as if I were on autopilot, I found myself looking forward to cleansing my face every morning and night. Like, more than my satisfying scalp scrub, more than my pre-shower dry brush ritual, more than applying my favorite face mask — using this cleanser quickly became the highlight of my self-care routine.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_11-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">It feels delicious on the skin, and the experience doesn't stop after the last remnants wash down the drain. The gentle formula leaves my skin feeling cleansed — not stripped — and baby soft. Not to mention, it has somehow made my skin look more radiant overtime, too.</p><figure id=mntl-sc-block_13-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block instyle-sc-block-image mntl-sc-block-universal-image mntl-sc-block-image--no-theme no-theme mntl-sc-block-image figure-portrait figure-low-res"><span class=figure-article-caption-owner><p>Courtesy</p></span></figure><p id=mntl-sc-block_14-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"><strong>To shop:</strong> $38; <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=externalLink data-ordinal=1 rel=nofollow>tatcha.com</a></p><p id=mntl-sc-block_16-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">The experience itself is enough to turn me into a loyal consumer, but it helps that the formula is packed with skin-healthy ingredients and leaves out the ones I actively avoid. For starters, it has a pH-neutral amino acid base that keeps skin balanced and feeling silky. Then, it has the previously-mentioned rice powder which gently buffs away impurities while keeping the skin moisturized and supple. It also has its signature <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=internalLink data-ordinal=1>red okinawa algae</a> and hyaluronic acid blend that replenishes the skin's moisture reservoir and locks it into the skin.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_20-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">All of Tatcha's products are formulated for even the most sensitive skin types — which although I don't have sensitive skin, I always appreciate in skincare. (Hey, life is rough enough for our skincare to be, too.) The Rice Wash is also non-comedogenic, cruelty-free, and doesn't use mineral oil, synthetic fragrances, sulfate detergents, parabens, or phtalates.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_22-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">Whenever I find an opportunity to make my life for more opulent — no matter how mundane — I take it. And considering how much peace this cleanser adds to my everyday life, it's more than earned its rightful place in my everyday routine.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_24-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">From non-toxic makeup and skincare to sustainability practices,&nbsp;<a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=internalLink data-ordinal=1>Clean Slate</a>&nbsp;is an exploration of all things in the green beauty space.
