I was convinced it was a vital story about the difficulties people face finding intimacy in a big city like London. Hanif Kureishi's writing couldn't have been more intimate and revealing, but I found the making of the film and the subsequent publicity and personal attacks very, very painful. I wish I hadn't made it."</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/i2-prod.dailystar.co.uk/incoming/article31908998.ece/ALTERNATES/s615b/0_INTIMACY-Mark-Rylance-Kerry-Fox-2001-c-Empire-Picturescourtesy-Everett-Collection.jpg><h5 class="publication-theme-icon publication-theme-border">Read More</h5><h5 class="hidden related-articles publication-theme-icon publication-font">Related Articles</h5><ul><li data-tmdatatrack=read-more data-tmdatatrack-articleid=31892161><a class="embed-image hidden" href=# data-link-tracking=InArticle|Rec|ReadMore|index1|Image aria-label="I'm A Celeb's Sam Thompson fears This Morning role will be axed after 'bloodbath' debut" data-tmdatatrack=read-more data-tmdatatrack-articleid=31892161><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/i2-prod.dailystar.co.uk/incoming/article31892184.ece/ALTERNATES/s458/0_This-Morning.jpg></a> <a href=# data-image=https://i2-prod.dailystar.co.uk/incoming/article31892184.ece/ALTERNATES/s615/0_This-Morning.jpg data-link-tracking=InArticle|Rec|ReadMore|index1|text data-tmdatatrack=read-more data-tmdatatrack-articleid=31892161>I'm A Celeb's Sam Thompson fears This Morning role will be axed after 'bloodbath' debut</a><img src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/s2-prod.mirror.co.uk/@trinitymirrordigital/chameleon-branding/publications/dailystar/img/logo-schema-dailystar.png alt=dailystar style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto></li></ul><h5 class="publication-theme-icon publication-theme-border">Read More</h5><h5 class="hidden related-articles publication-theme-icon publication-font">Related Articles</h5><ul><li data-tmdatatrack=read-more data-tmdatatrack-articleid=31891421><a class="embed-image hidden" href=# data-link-tracking=InArticle|Rec|ReadMore|index2|Image aria-label="Rebel Wilson slips into swimsuit as she shares 2st weight gain in emotional confession" data-tmdatatrack=read-more data-tmdatatrack-articleid=31891421><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/s2-prod.mirror.co.uk/@trinitymirrordigital/chameleon-branding/publications/dailystar/img/logo-schema-dailystar.png></a> <a href=# data-image=https://i2-prod.dailystar.co.uk/incoming/article31891469.ece/ALTERNATES/s615/0_Rebel-Wilson.jpg data-link-tracking=InArticle|Rec|ReadMore|index2|text data-tmdatatrack=read-more data-tmdatatrack-articleid=31891421>Rebel Wilson slips into swimsuit as she shares 2st weight gain in emotional confession</a><img src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/s2-prod.mirror.co.uk/@trinitymirrordigital/chameleon-branding/publications/dailystar/img/logo-schema-dailystar.png alt=dailystar style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto></li></ul><p>In Intimacy, Mark starred as a nightclub worker who abandoned his faimly as his wife lost interest in him.

Intimacy went on to win accolades including a top prize at the Berlin International Film Festival. However, it also received backlash from some reviewers. In a previous interview, Mark confessed: "It was disturbing. I thought how easily I could have been that guy."</p><p>In a 2015 interview with The Wall Street Journal, Mark claimed that the scenes put stress on his marriage. He told the publication: "It soured me on my life two months. It’s my mistake, but I felt Patrice [Chéreau] put undue pressure on me on set to do that. And at that point I didn’t have the confidence as a film actor to say no. Now I think a lot of actors that people say are difficult are actually just being sensible.”</p><p><i><b>For more of the latest showbiz and TV news from the Daily Star, make sure you sign up for one of our newsletters <a data-content-type=section data-link-tracking=InArticle|Link href=# rel=follow>here</a>.</b></i></p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7pa3IpbCsrJGne6S7ja6iaKuYpMSjtdlomauhpGKupMDIp55mpJWcsq%2BwjJqbpqGkqHqzscarnK1lY2aGcYSYcWg%3D</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./rihanna-savage-x-fenty-bridal-lingerie-shop.html><span>←</span><span>Attn brides: Rihanna's sexy new bridal lingerie is just what you need for your wedding night</span></a>
