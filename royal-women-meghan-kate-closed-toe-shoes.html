She also opted for a pair of sandals for a trip to the beach in Australia - which undoubtedly even the Queen would be accepting of.</p><img alt="Kate Middleton's shoes" title="Kate Middleton's shoes" width=1632 height=2783 decoding=async data-nimg=1 sizes=100vw src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/hips.hearstapps.com/cosmouk.cdnds.net/16/32/kate-middleton-shoes-81.jpg style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center><a rel=noopener href=# class="pinterest css-1i6sckr e1c1bym14"><img data-dynamic-svg=true src="https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.harpersbazaar.com/_assets/design-tokens/fre/static/icons/social/pinterest.e8cf655.svg?primary=%2523ffffff" data-testid=dynamic-svg-base height=auto width=auto alt=pinterest style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center></a><p><span class="css-1urwh1q e1geg53v1">Getty Images</span></p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=18 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">So it looks as though the new Duchess of Sussex will be incorporating an array of multi-coloured court shoes into her wardrobe for the forseeable future, but we're looking forward to seeing her interpretation of the royal dress code.</p><h6 class="css-ok56rr e94w1mj3"><span aria-hidden=true class="css-0 eagam8p0"></span><span class="css-8lle59 e94w1mj1">Related Story</span><span aria-hidden=true class="css-0 eagam8p1"></span></h6><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7qa3RqZyrq5KWx6Kt0WeaqKVfqrhwssCsn6KnnmSuc32PbXBubGRkv7DFwKVksKedmrtuucSgn5qmXaCutbGMnKOoq5WZerW7xGaqoaeVqHw%3D</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./jonas-jeberg-signs-with-sony-music-publishing.html><span>←</span><span>Jonas Jeberg Signs With Sony Music Publishing</span></a>
