Timothy Schofield was found guilty of child sex offences. At the time, Phillip said: &nbsp;"These are despicable crimes, and I welcome the guilty verdicts.

We’re the best of friends - as always, she is an incredible support on screen, behind the scenes and on the phone. Holly has always been there for me, through thick and thin. And I’ve been there for her. The last few weeks haven’t been easy for either of us.<br></p><p id=eqnOLPMU3AC data-wc=58>"My family went through a real ordeal. Holly’s support throughout meant the world to me, as did the support of my bosses at ITV, my editor Martin Frizell and the whole&nbsp;This Morning&nbsp;family, including our amazing viewers. And of course, Holly has herself been ill with shingles. Whatever happens, we still have each other to count on."</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/images.hellomagazine.com/horizon/original_aspect_ratio/ab49c7db01e3-holly-and-phillip-on-this-morning-sofa.jpg><p id=eOrFtd-aX4h data-wc=49>Eamonn Holmes, who previously presented This Morning and worked alongside Holly and Phil, spoke about the situation on GB News, sharing: "I think there should have been a special award for Phillip Schofield and Holly Willoughby for best actors… He's brought in lawyers, she's brought in a PR team.</p><p id=ezPd3t8psi data-wc=12><strong>MORE:&nbsp;</strong><a class=hm-link href=#>Everything Holly Willoughby and Phillip Schofield have said about their friendship</a></p><p id=ehw6ZMQfdho data-wc=60>"The public surely will suss that there's no chemistry, that it's a broken fit between the two of them and that This Morning does not depend on who presents it. It's an institution. It will carry on no matter who presents it and anyone can check the viewing figures, there's no difference between whether they present it or anyone else."</p><p id=eLEO8sY3sB0 data-wc=73>Lorraine Kelly, who also works at ITV with the pair, told The Sun that it was "business as usual" on set. She said: "Do you know what they were back today and it was business as usual and everyone is just getting on with it… I would be sad if they left the show. But I don’t think that is ever likely to happen and I think they’re just getting on with it."</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/images.hellomagazine.com/horizon/original_aspect_ratio/8ac339a80ef8-phillip-and-holly-this-morning.jpg><p id=eUVdlGEAolr data-wc=31>The pair faced heavy scrutiny back in late 2022 following the death of the Queen when they were snapped in the press line to witness the monarch’s body lying in state.</p><p id=ep_FGRWAEyt data-wc=26>Holly addressed the situation in a voiceover on This Morning, saying: "Like hundreds of accredited broadcasters and journalists we were given permission to access the hall.</p><p id=eyf79JFu26 data-wc=15><strong>MORE:</strong><a class=hm-link href=#>&nbsp;Holly Willoughby makes swift exit from This Morning in unexpected move amid fallout reports</a></p><p id=eah8Vrnt_h data-wc=17><strong>MORE: <a class=hm-link href=#>Holly Willoughby and Phillip Schofield's future This Morning episodes addressed in new update amid rumoured rift</a>&nbsp;</strong></p><br><p id=emFngTCyDbj data-wc=53>"None of the broadcasters and journalists there took anyone's place in the queue and no one filed past the Queen.
