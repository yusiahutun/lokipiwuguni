Her parents, Leonard Maxime Francois and Tamaki Osaka met in the 1990s in Sapporo, Japan. Tamaki’s family considered her friendship with a Haitian man to be a disgrace, but Tamaki and Francois eventually married. Likewise, she was born in 1997, 18 months after her older sister, Mari, in the city of Osaka. To make it simpler in Japan, the girls were assigned their mother’s surname.</p><p>Francois was encouraged to take a similar direction with his daughters after watching Venus and Serena Williams at the French Open in 1999 and discovering how their father had taught them. Osaka’s family moved to the United States at the age of three years old. They moved to Long Island to live with her father’s parents, and she and her sister started playing tennis. The family relocated to Florida in 2006, where the girls played tennis with their father during the day. They had been to high school in New York, but now they were homeschooled at night. During this time, Osaka’s mother struggled to support the family.</p><img decoding=async aria-describedby=caption-attachment-110130 src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/fresherpost.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/Naomi-Osaka-childhood-picture.jpg alt width=650 height=411 data-sizes="(max-width: 650px) 100vw, 650px" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center><p id=caption-attachment-110130 class=wp-caption-text>Caption: Naomi Osaka childhood picture (Source: Instagram)</p><p>When on the court together, Osaka and Mari were close but wanting to beat Mari in a match inspired Osaka for years. Osaka told CNN,</p><p>“It took 12 years to beat her,” . “It was probably one of the biggest moments of my career. She beat me probably more than 1,000 times over my childhood.”</p><p>Mari had early potential as a player, but injuries hampered her progress. The Japanese side of Osaka’s family was initially suspicious that her tennis career would pay off, but they changed their minds as she progressed.</p><h2><span id=Naomi_Osaka_8211_Net_Worth_2022>Naomi Osaka – Net Worth 2022</span></h2><p>Naomi Osaka makes a living as a professional tennis player. She is one of the world’s rising tennis stars. She makes a lot of money from prizes, rewards, contracts, sponsorships, companies, and promotions. In 2018, she had a lot of results. She is one of the highest-paid female athletes in the world. In 2018, she officially received about $15 million from endorsements. To date, Osaka has earned more than $17 million in career earnings from competitions. Similarly, her <strong>net worth</strong> is estimated to be $37 million.</p><h2><span id=Professional_Life>Professional Life</span></h2><p>Osaka, who stands 5-feet-11, missed junior tournaments and began her career on pro satellite tours, similar to Venus and Serena. She turned pro in 2013 and was named the Women’s Tennis Association’s “Newcomer of the Year” in 2016. Her first WTA tour victory came in March 2018 at Indian Wells, California. Osaka then won the US Open in September 2018, becoming the first Japanese player to win a Grand Slam title. She won the Australian Open in January 2019, becoming the first player since 2001 to capture the major title that followed her first Grand Slam victory. The victory also vaulted Osaka to the top of the world rankings, a first for any Asian player, male or female.</p><p>After the 2019 Australian Open, Osaka parted ways with Sascha Bajin, her mentor for her two Grand Slam victories. There was no official explanation for the move. Jermaine Jenkins was her next mentor, but by 2020, she had moved to Wim Fissette. She had even struggled on the court for most of 2019, hampered at times by a knee injury. Wimbledon was a particular loss for her because she did not compete past the first day. She later revealed that she was attempting to re-enjoy the role, tweeting on July 31 that she was “relearning that happy feeling” and was hopeful about her future.</p><img decoding=async aria-describedby=caption-attachment-110131 src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/fresherpost.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/Naomi-Osaka-featuring-at-a-magazine.jpg alt width=650 height=811 data-sizes="(max-width: 650px) 100vw, 650px" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center><p id=caption-attachment-110131 class=wp-caption-text>Caption: Naomi Osaka featuring at a magazine(Source: Instagram)</p><h4>More</h4><p>Similarly, she showed her sportsmanship at the 2019 U.S. Open by welcoming losing opponent Coco Gauff to join her in a post-game interview after their third-round match because she didn’t want the younger player to suffer alone. Osaka didn’t progress beyond the fourth round of that tournament, but she did win in Osaka and Beijing later that year.</p><p>Likewise, she was set to represent Japan at the 2020 Olympics in Tokyo after losing to Gauff in the third round of the Australian Open in 2020, but the COVID-19 pandemic forced the event to be postponed.</p><p>She explained the delay,</p><p>“Of course I am disappointed that it won’t happen this year, but we’ll all be ready to go stronger than ever in 2021.”</p><p>Moreover, she won the 2020 U.S. Open by beating Victoria Azarenka in the finals 1-6, 6-3, 6-3. Before a contest, Osaka likes to listen to music, usually rap or hip-hop, and she will listen to the same song over and over again before she loses.</p><h2><span id=Relationship_Status>Relationship Status</span></h2><p>Naomi Osaka is currently in a relationship. <strong>Cordae</strong>, an American rapper, is her boyfriend. It is unclear when they began dating, but the two are in a long-term relationship. She has been able to balance her career and personal life successfully. More information about their affair will be added as it becomes available.</p><img decoding=async aria-describedby=caption-attachment-110132 src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/fresherpost.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/Naomi-Osaka-with-her-boy-friend.jpg alt width=650 height=812 data-sizes="(max-width: 650px) 100vw, 650px" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center><p id=caption-attachment-110132 class=wp-caption-text>Caption: Naomi Osaka with her boyfriend (Source: Instagram)</p><h2><span id=Body_Measurements>Body Measurements</span></h2><p>The 23-year-old player stands at a <strong>height</strong> of 5 feet 11 inches and weighs around 69 kg.
