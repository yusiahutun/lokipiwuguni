Naturally tickets for the event have proved incredibly popular, with fans snapping them up as soon as they went on sale.</p><p>But Spurs chiefs are still yet to get the green light from Haringey Council to host an extra date, as they have already reached the quota on their licence for this year. Tottenham's state-of-the-art multi-purpose stadium is permitted to hold up to six music events every calendar year, but the extra Beyonce show will make it seven.</p><p><b>READ MORE: <a data-content-type=news data-link-tracking=InArticle|Link href=# rel=follow>Unseen footage shows idiot fan's two-footed tackle on Andy Robertson as teen is arrested</a></b></p><p>The former Destiny's Child singer is booked in to perform across five nights as part of her Renaissance world tour, while Red Hot Chili Peppers and Wizkid are each set to appear for one night only in July. According to <a href=# rel=nofollow>The Telegraph</a>, Tottenham are allowed to host 16 non-football events per year.</p><p>The club generates considerable revenue from hosting a range of events, including NFL, Rugby Union and boxing matches. General admission tickets to see Beyonce have all been accounted for, though some premium packages are still available, albeit at the costly sum of over £350 each.</p><p>A decision on whether Tottenham will be able to host the extra date will be determined in a scheduled upcoming meeting, with the club seeking a special licence to be granted for the occasion.</p><p>Tottenham declined to comment on the matter.</p><p>Councillor Dana Carlin of Haringey Council said: “We value what Tottenham Hotspur bring to the local community and the benefits of having a world class multipurpose stadium in our borough. Welcoming global superstars, like Beyonce, will attract thousands of music fans and benefits our local businesses.<u></u><u></u></p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/i2-prod.mirror.co.uk/incoming/article29386021.ece/ALTERNATES/s615b/0_Lady-Gaga-The-Chromatica-Ball-Tour-London.jpg> <img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/i2-prod.dailystar.co.uk/incoming/article28196890.ece/ALTERNATES/s615b/0_JS280068919.jpg><p><u><br></u>“However, there is a planning process that needs to be followed. The stadium already has permission to host six music concerts per year and the impact on local residents has to be balanced against this. We are disappointed that we have got to this stage.</p><p>“Tottenham Hotspur have been advised that they must engage with the community, ward councillors and submit a planning application which the council will determine with an open mind. We will continue to advise and work with the club in order to resolve this issue.”</p><p>Tottenham have only recently announced a 15-year partnership with Formula One, which will include the world’s first in-stadium electric karting facility and London’s longest indoor track installed underneath Tottenham's South Stand.</p><p>Spurs co-owner Daniel Levy said of the partnership: "Since building this stadium our ambition has always been to see how far we can push the boundaries in delivering world-class experiences that will attract people from around the world all year round.</p><p>"We have been able to bring the biggest names in sport and entertainment to London N17. We are extremely excited about what this long-term partnership with F1 will bring for our global, national and local communities."</p><p><b>READ NEXT:</b></p><ul><li><a data-content-type=news data-link-tracking=InArticle|Link href=# rel=follow><b>Ranking football's eight most humiliating defeats ever after Liverpool 7-0 Man Utd</b></a></li><li><p><a data-content-type=news data-link-tracking=InArticle|Link href=# rel=follow><b>'Most shameful captaincy performance ever' proves Bruno Fernandes doesn't deserve armband</b></a></p></li><li><p><a data-content-type=news data-link-tracking=InArticle|Link href=# rel=follow><b>Ex-footballer who dates fellow porn star was 'butt-naked sweating mess on first shoot'</b></a></p></li></ul><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7pa3IpbCsrJGne6S7ja6iaKugpL%2B1e8Wopq2akaG5cMDOraueppiWum6%2F05qboq2dYq%2Bmxc6nmp5lk6S7pLHRrWScp6WjsKq4jGtwbHBla315</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./archewell-foundation-announces-naacp-foundation-award-harry-meghan-html.html><span>←</span><span>Archewell Foundation partners with NAACP to announce this year's winner of their Digital Civil Right</span></a>
