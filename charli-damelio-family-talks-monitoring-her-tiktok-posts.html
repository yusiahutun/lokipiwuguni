They don't really care what you have to say. They don't care if you apologize. They don't care if you're truly sorry. They just want to make you feel bad," Charli explained in the interview with NBC's Gadi Schwartz.</p><p>Thankfully, Charli and Dixie have their parents to fall back on for support in hard times, although sometimes they have to draw the line when they think their daughters are about to make a mistake -- like posting a dance that is a bit too suggestive.</p><p>"The [WAP dance], for me, I don't want my 16-year-old doing that on the internet. She did do it. She didn't post it," Heidi said of Charli, adding, "She'll come to us and say, 'Should I post this? I'm nervous.' I'm like, if you're feeling that, you have your own answer. Once it's out there, it's out there and you can't take it back...Some things we make her take down, but for the most part, she has good judgement."</p><p>During the candid interview, Charli also revealed that she's struggled living in her older sister's shadow and at times in life was even referred to as the "ugly sister."</p><p>"People used to say I was the ugly sister or I was the fat sister and I always wanted to be just like Dixie because she seemed so happy. She had so many friends. At that point in our lives, we weren't that close, so we didn't talk often," Charli revealed.</p><p>Thankfully, once she hit high school, the sisters connected on a new level. Thanks to TikTok, the duo are now closer than ever and it's safe to say that they both have their equal share of the spotlight.</p><a class="article-block__link js-track-link" href=# data-node-ref=toofab:article:345b82ee-f2fc-4b7a-8efa-4462a3ac772d data-container-ref=toofab:article:6bf505e2-9420-4111-aab9-5055604d2a64 data-context='{"section":"article-block","name":"article"}' readability=27><img src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/images.toofab.com/image/5c/5by4/2020/07/09/5cb9d820588a421bb1ccf7cf3ca369d7_xs.jpg width=300 height=240 style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center> <span class="media-credit article-block__media-credit">Instagram</span><p><h4 class="article-block__card-title article-block__card-title--has-credit">Addison Rae Issues Apology For Posting Anti Black Lives Matter Video</h4><span class=article-block__cta-text>View Story</span></p></a><p>While Charli has become the most followed person on the app, with a whopping 83 million followers, and has a book on the way, Dixie has forged her own path with an acting and singing career. For now, her enrollment at University of Alabama will have to wait.</p><p>"I was still planning on going but with traveling back and forth...it just wasn't worth it because then I would have to quarantine and would be putting people at school and my home in danger. It was easier if I stayed home...I think [it's on the back burner.] I do want to go to college, but maybe [in LA]," Dixie revealed.</p><p>As for the D'Amelio's future? They don't know exactly what's in store but one thing is for sure -- nothing is going to break them apart.</p><p>"We would walk away from this before that happened," they concluded.</p><a class="article-block__link js-track-link" href=# data-node-ref=toofab:article:524d21d1-7880-4b15-994a-f389198c7ebb data-container-ref=toofab:article:6bf505e2-9420-4111-aab9-5055604d2a64 data-context='{"section":"article-block","name":"article"}' readability=27><img src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/images.toofab.com/image/e5/5by4/2020/08/18/e59e3add7e56481094804bfe42c3b0de_xs.jpg width=300 height=240 style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center> <span class="media-credit article-block__media-credit">Instagram</span><p><h4 class="article-block__card-title article-block__card-title--has-credit">How Much TikTok’s Biggest Stars Make</h4><span class=article-block__cta-text>View Story</span></p></a><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmisn6Szoq6NnKamZ2Jlf3F7j3FmbGlfmLWivsuiZJ2ZnZq5qruMn5imoZyuerWty6SqZqWfo7a1u9GipaBlmJq%2FbsDIpKuoo12lvLTA0mg%3D</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./bryan-cranston-66-shows-dramatic-transformation-html.html><span>←</span><span>Bryan Cranston, 66, shows off dramatic transformation</span></a>
