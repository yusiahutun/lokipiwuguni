Per the <a href=#>Nashville Post</a>, the building was originally the&nbsp;Addison Avenue Cumberland Presbyterian Church, which opened in 1903; in 1968, Fred Foster, the founder of Monument Records, bought the property and converted the building into a studio.</p><p>Brown bought the property, for $900,000, in March of 2012, and spent about $4 million updating both the building and its recording equipment, all of which will be included with the sale. In addition to its multiple studios, Southern Ground features a loft, a basement and a full kitchen.</p><p>“It’s not every day that a property with such a prime location and offering a building with this level of high-end recording studio equipment and technology is offered for sale,” says Mark Kresser of <a href=#>Exit Real Estate</a>, who is overseeing the sale. He adds that Brown is not ready to share if he is planning to open another recording studio after the sale of Southern Ground.</p><p>Zac Brown Band, like the rest of the music world, are currently off the road due to the ongoing coronavirus (COVID-19) pandemic. The band opted to <a href=#>outright cancel</a>, rather than postpone, both the remainder of their 2020&nbsp;Owl Tour and 2020 Roar With the Lions Tour in mid-March, as pandemic-related shutdowns were beginning.</p><p><strong>Here's What Zac Brown's Southern Ground Studio Looks Like Inside:</strong></p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmiskajBprvFnKaupqSnxm%2BvzqZmrKelqbWmvs1mnqunpaOxbr%2FTrpuip12ltqTA1KucrGWWpL9uv8ClnGamkai1t7XLpZxo</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./youtuber-reenacts-little-mermaid-gay-fairy-tale-html.html><span>←</span><span>YouTuber reenacts The Little Mermaid into gay fairy tale</span></a>
