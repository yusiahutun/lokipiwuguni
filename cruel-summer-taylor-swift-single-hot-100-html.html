But the reaction to “Cruel Summer” felt different, ranging from the <a href=#>fantastical</a> to the <a href=#>sweetly deranged</a>. What was it about this neon-toned synth-pop track that resonated more than others? It could have been anything from “This song is so good it HAS to be known by the general public” to “Taylor deserves to top the Hot 100 in perpetuity” type hyperbole. Most likely, though, it was a feeling that Swift’s image was still slightly dinged after the fallout from the 1989 era and that the singles released from Lover — including “ME!” and “You Need to Calm Down” — weren’t as representative of Swift’s seventh album or her sharp songwriting skills. “Cruel Summer,” with its empathetic narrative, anthemic chorus, and dazzling bridge, was.</p><p class=clay-paragraph data-editable=text data-uri=www.vulture.com/_components/clay-paragraph/instances/cllp5y5if000g3b6urpk4kznx@published data-word-count=104>This June, Swift finally granted her fans’ wishes and released the four-year-old song as a single, even as she was in the midst of promoting Speak Now (Taylor’s Version) and a deluxe edition of Midnights. Despite its straightforward pop credentials, the track’s journey to getting an official release is an unusually twisty one — a slow-burn success story that involves an indie-rock icon, Ellen DeGeneres, and a royalty dispute. Now, “Cruel Summer” is shaping up to be Swift’s biggest hit of the year, finally landing at No. 1 on the Hot 100.

Swift credits the tour with having “assign[ed] humanity” to her life and art —reminding her that, despite beef and backlash having changed the trajectory of her career, she still had fans who would treat her like a real person.

She says that for this song, she and Antonoff “revisited” the idea of a bridge being “the biggest moment of the song,” first attempted on “Out of the Woods.”</p><p class=clay-paragraph data-editable=text data-uri=www.vulture.com/_components/clay-paragraph/instances/cllp5y6p6000s3b6ux606kgy9@published data-word-count=55>The same day, Swift surprises fans at a “Cruel Summer” promotional mural that’s been painted in Brooklyn, sparking further speculation it’s the next single.
