Ruth later bared all in the stage production of Calendar Girls, and last appeared on our screens in medical drama Casualty in 2019.</p><p>Ruth sadly died at the age of 79 after she had surgery following a fall she had earlier in the week.</p><p>Her agent revealed that she died on Friday, December 9, while in hospital as they added: "A real legend of the British entertainment scene she was one of a kind and a unique talent loved by many. She is gone far too soon. Our hearts are broken!"</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/i2-prod.mirror.co.uk/incoming/article26932636.ece/ALTERNATES/s615b/0_PS_11052022hidehi_11.jpg><h3>Yvonne Stuart-Hargreaves (Diane Holland)</h3><p>The supercilious Yvonne, spouse of the rather more tranquil Barry, caused a lot of friction - and laughs - by believing she was socially above most of the other Maplins staff members.</p><p>When her time at the holiday camp ended, actress Dianne appeared in sitcom The Upper Hand and as a music teacher in Jersey-based detective drama Bergerac, with John Nettles.</p><p>She also appeared in <a href=# rel=follow data-link-tracking=InArticle|Link data-content-type=news>Are You Being Served</a> spin-off Grace and Favour, where she appeared as infamous female magistrate Celia Littlewood.</p><p>She went on to play the maiden aunt in The Nutcracker in The Royal Ballet at Covent Garden and later appeared in <a href=# rel=follow data-link-tracking=InArticle|Link data-content-type=section-topic>Casualty</a> in 2001.</p><p>Yvonne died in 2009 at the age of 78.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/i2-prod.mirror.co.uk/incoming/article26932634.ece/ALTERNATES/s615b/0_PS_11052022hidehi_06.jpg><h3>Peggy Ollerenshaw (Su Pollard)</h3><p>The ditzy chalet maid was desperate to become a Yellowcoat and would attempt to get involved in the action any way she could.</p><p>Actress <a href=# rel=follow data-link-tracking=InArticle|Link data-content-type=news>Su Pollard </a>played the role to perfection, often with hilarious results.</p><p>Following Hi-de-Hi! Su appeared in more TV comedies including You Rang, M'Lord? and Oh, Doctor Beeching! and performed alongside David Hasselhoff in Peter Pan at the Theatre Royal.</p><p>Su has also presented Songs of Praise three times, enjoyed four appearances on Radio 4’s panel game Just a Minute, and in December 2010 made a guest appearance in hit <a href=# rel=follow data-link-tracking=InArticle|Link data-content-type=section-topic>ITV</a> comedy Benidorm. She was also a guest on <a href=# rel=follow data-link-tracking=InArticle|Link data-content-type=news>Strictly Come Dancing</a>, enjoyed a short-lived pop career and made countless appearances in children’s pantomimes and various musicals.</p><p>Last year she also appeared in TV’s celebrity <a href=# rel=follow data-link-tracking=InArticle|Link data-content-type=section-topic>MasterChef </a>– which she described as ‘stressful’.</p><p>Show host John Torode was unimpressed by her infamous chicken blunder, where she ‘hacked at it’ while plating up. Needless to say, she didn’t win.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/i2-prod.mirror.co.uk/incoming/article26932627.ece/ALTERNATES/s615b/0_PS_11052022hidehi.jpg><h3><span>Barry Stuart Hargreaves (Barry Howard)</span><br></h3><p>Mild-mannered dance instructor Barry was the perfect foil to his rather snobby spouse Yvonne. He exuded a quiet dignity and forever seemed intent on rising above it all, usually with an arched eyebrow.</p><p>Post-Hi-de-Hi! actor Barry went on to join You Rang, M'Lord, as well as appearing in the George Cole comedy, Dad.</p><p>He was the subject of This Is Your Life, hosted by Michael Aspe<a href=# rel=follow data-link-tracking=InArticle|Link>l</a>, in 1989, and was the narrator of The Rocky Horror Show on tour in the early 90s.</p><p>Barry also appeared in 1994 sitcom The House Of Windsor.</p><p>Barry, who lived in Poole, also starred with Bernard Cribbins in <a href=# rel=follow data-link-tracking=InArticle|Link data-content-type=section-topic>David Tennant's</a> final <a href=# rel=follow data-link-tracking=InArticle|Link data-content-type=section-topic>Doctor Who</a> episodes in 2009. Barry died in 2016, aged 78.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/i2-prod.mirror.co.uk/incoming/article26932632.ece/ALTERNATES/s615b/1_PS_11052022hidehi_10.jpg><h3>Ted Bovis (Paul Shane)</h3><p>A central character to Hi-de-Hi! Ted was the Teddy Boy-quiffed, side-burn sporting rock ’n’ roller of the camp. Bedecked in loud checked jackets and a natural on the mic, he made the perfect camp host.</p><p>Actor Paul Shane went on to join You Rang, M’Lord, and also had his own early 90s TV series Very Big, Very Soon, where he starred as a down-at-heel actor’s agent. Throughout the decade he made appearances in <a href=# rel=follow data-link-tracking=InArticle|Link data-content-type=section-topic>Holby City</a>, A Touch of Frost, <a href=# rel=follow data-link-tracking=InArticle|Link data-content-type=section-topic>Emmerdale</a> and countless other theatre and pantomime performances. He died in 2013, aged 72.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/i2-prod.mirror.co.uk/incoming/article26932635.ece/ALTERNATES/s615b/0_PS_11052022hidehi_08.jpg><h3>Spike Dixon (Jeffrey Holland)</h3><p>Camp comic Spike came as a double-act alongside camp host Ted Bovis.</p><p>Like many other cast members, when Hi-de-Hi! ended he joined You Rang M’Lord and also appeared in The Russ Abbott Show, Oh! Doctor Beeching and <a href=# rel=follow data-link-tracking=InArticle|Link data-content-type=section-topic>Coronation Street</a> – as Clive Drinkwater.</p><p>Actor Jeffrey appeared in comedy drama The National Union of Space People in 2016 and was last seen on our screens in the sitcom Simply Ken, in 2021.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/i2-prod.mirror.co.uk/incoming/article26932631.ece/ALTERNATES/s615b/0_PS_11052022hidehi_02.jpg><h3>Clive Dempster (David Griffin)</h3><p>It was all change come 1960 at Maplins, as this aristocratic war hero replaced Jeffrey Fairbrother as entertainment manager. The squadron leader and maverick ladies’ man was the polar opposite of the shy Jeffrey.</p><p>When his time at the camp ended, actor David enjoyed a four-year stint as Emmet Hawksworth in 90s hit comedy Keeping Up Appearances, with Patricia Routledge. He also appeared in what was then known as Emmerdale Farm, Doctor Who and ‘Allo ‘Allo.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/i2-prod.mirror.co.uk/incoming/article26932630.ece/ALTERNATES/s615b/0_PS_11052022hidehi_03.jpg><h3>Fred Quilley (Felix Bowness)</h3><p>Riding instructor Fred and his shady past of fixing horse races brought a little undercurrent of darkness to Crimpton-on-Sea.</p><p>Actor Felix went on to – there’s a trend developing here – appear in You Rang, M’Lord and Oh, Dr Beeching! He also enjoyed being in The Benny Hill Show, the Goodies, Dad’s Army, Porridge, The Liver Birds and Are You Being Served?</p><p>Felix died in 2009. He was 87.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/i2-prod.mirror.co.uk/incoming/article26932637.ece/ALTERNATES/s615b/0_PS_11052022hidehi_07.jpg><h3>Professor Jeffrey Fairbrother (Simon Cadell)</h3><p>The uptight Cambridge-educated professor-cum-entertainment manager prompted many laughs through being completely at odds with his more down-to-earth staff.</p><p>When the show ended he took to the stage and even received an Olivier Award for his role in the adaptation of Grahame Green’s Travels With My Aunt. He also appeared in wheeler-dealer comedy-drama Minder and sitcom Singles. Simon died in 1996, he was 45.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/i2-prod.mirror.co.uk/incoming/article26932628.ece/ALTERNATES/s615b/0_PS_11052022hidehi_09.jpg><h3>Sylvia Garnsey (Nikki Kelly)</h3><p>Glamorous Yellowcoat Sylvia was a long-serving member at the camp, appearing in all nine series.</p><p>Post-Hi-de-Hi!, actress Nikki appeared in sitcom The Upper Hand and panel game show As Seen On TV. She went on to star as the Wicked Queen Griselda in panto Snow White and the Seven Dwarves, reprising the role many times. She also appeared as the Evil Queen or Fairy Caboose in numerous versions of Sleeping Beauty, as well as the Wicked Witch in a panto version of The Wizard of Oz.</p><h5 class="publication-theme-icon publication-theme-border">Read More</h5><h5 class="hidden related-articles publication-theme-icon publication-font">Related Articles</h5><ul><li data-tmdatatrack=read-more data-tmdatatrack-articleid=26868546><a class="embed-image hidden" href=# data-link-tracking=InArticle|Rec|ReadMore|index1|Image aria-label="Crystal Maze presenters now - from Hollywood movies to cut Harry Potter scenes " data-tmdatatrack=read-more data-tmdatatrack-articleid=26868546><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/i2-prod.mirror.co.uk/incoming/article26868867.ece/ALTERNATES/s458/1_PS_04052022crystal.jpg></a> <a href=# data-image=https://i2-prod.mirror.co.uk/incoming/article26868867.ece/ALTERNATES/s615/1_PS_04052022crystal.jpg data-link-tracking=InArticle|Rec|ReadMore|index1|text data-tmdatatrack=read-more data-tmdatatrack-articleid=26868546>Crystal Maze presenters now - from Hollywood movies to cut Harry Potter scenes </a><img src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/s2-prod.mirror.co.uk/@trinitymirrordigital/chameleon-branding/publications/dailystar/img/logo-schema-dailystar.png alt=dailystar style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto></li></ul><h5 class="publication-theme-icon publication-theme-border">Read More</h5><h5 class="hidden related-articles publication-theme-icon publication-font">Related Articles</h5><ul><li data-tmdatatrack=read-more data-tmdatatrack-articleid=26870658><a class="embed-image hidden" href=# data-link-tracking=InArticle|Rec|ReadMore|index2|Image aria-label="London's Burning cast now - from Hollywood blockbusters to professional poker player" data-tmdatatrack=read-more data-tmdatatrack-articleid=26870658><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/s2-prod.mirror.co.uk/@trinitymirrordigital/chameleon-branding/publications/dailystar/img/logo-schema-dailystar.png></a> <a href=# data-image=https://i2-prod.mirror.co.uk/incoming/article26871071.ece/ALTERNATES/s615/1_Contact-LWT-Picture-Publicity-on-0171-261-34843474-for-further-information.jpg data-link-tracking=InArticle|Rec|ReadMore|index2|text data-tmdatatrack=read-more data-tmdatatrack-articleid=26870658>London's Burning cast now - from Hollywood blockbusters to professional poker player</a><img src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/s2-prod.mirror.co.uk/@trinitymirrordigital/chameleon-branding/publications/dailystar/img/logo-schema-dailystar.png alt=dailystar style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto></li></ul><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7pa3IpbCsrJGne6S7ja6iaKymZMSprdNmn6JllJp6qbWMrKuaqqNif3eFlGttb3E%3D</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./shania-twain-giddy-up.html><span>←</span><span>Shania Twain's 'Giddy Up' Spreads Joy, Pure and Simple</span></a>
