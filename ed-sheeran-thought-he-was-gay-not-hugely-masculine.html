Ed Sheeran looked around him when he was younger and realized he didn't quite fit in to the expected norms for young men. As such, he admitted that he actually wondered if he might be gay.

"I love musical theatre, I love pop music, I love Britney Spears," he said. "My masculine side probably stops at drinking beer and watching football."</p><p>But even in the case of football (soccer), he said he prefers watching the women's league, having switched over to it after daughter Lyra's birth. "I watched it and I was like, ‘I don’t know why I watch male football, this is much better,'" he admitted.</p><p>He even questioned himself because he's "not a car guy. I like a nice car, but I'm not a car guy." In other words, young Ed had internalized all these outside expectations about what it is to be a straight man's man, and when he saw himself fall short, he found himself questioning everything about who he was, including his own sexuality.</p><a class="article-block__link js-track-link" href=# data-node-ref=toofab:article:4b7f2f62-514c-4f1e-bc2e-bdcadc7b6a6d data-container-ref=toofab:article:00b3fb9b-5d26-4320-81b8-587abf043fb5 data-context='{"section":"article-block","name":"article"}' readability=28><img src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/images.toofab.com/image/8f/5by4/2021/10/27/8f7e03dd81714fa98a68456d73c7a7cb_xs.jpg width=300 height=240 style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center> <span class="media-credit article-block__media-credit">NBC</span><p><h4 class="article-block__card-title article-block__card-title--has-credit">Voice 500th Episode 5th Judge: Ed Sheeran Reveals Terribly Out of Tune 14-Year-Old Singing</h4><span class=article-block__cta-text>View Story</span></p></a><p>While he's since come to understand that he's not gay, he's just his own person with his own likes and interests, Sheeran has continued his love and appreciation for strong women, just like the ones who drew him to the women's football league.</p><p>His wife Cherry Seaborn is "super pro-women and femininity," he explained, which has had a big influence over him. "She works a very high level job where she’s the top of her field."</p><p>"As soon as we started dating my life kind of shifted to that," Sheeran said. "She plays in a female hockey team, we hang out with them all the time. It’s very much like women empowerment."</p><p>Now that he's an official girl dad, he's all in. "Before Lyra was born it was kind of that but now Lyra is born it’s even more that."</p><a id=gallery-link-352f42d1-0db5-4dfc-99f6-e4559c47cb62 class="media-link gallery-block__link js-track-link js-click-gallery" href=# data-node-ref=toofab:gallery:352f42d1-0db5-4dfc-99f6-e4559c47cb62 data-context='{"name":"gallery-block","section":"permalink"}' data-container-ref=toofab:article:00b3fb9b-5d26-4320-81b8-587abf043fb5 data-gallery-layout=carousel><img src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/images.toofab.com/image/5f/4by3/2021/11/01/5feeae350b284ff6810f5872c5919c00_md.jpg width=825 height=618 style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center></a> <span class="media-credit gallery-block__media-credit">Instagram</span><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmisn6Szoq6NnKamZ2Jlf3J7kGlmbGlfmrFuv8eenKuZnmLBqbvUoJ%2BtZZiaerit0maemrFdo7y1eceunp6kqWK6or%2FCrqOippVk</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./any-kind-of-fruit-galette.html><span>←</span><span>any-kind-of-fruit galette</span></a>
