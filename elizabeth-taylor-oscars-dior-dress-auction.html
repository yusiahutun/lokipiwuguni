It is now joining the listings in an upcoming <a href=# data-vars-ga-outbound-link="https://www.kerrytaylorauctions.com/auction/details/-passion-for-fashion/?au=120" data-vars-ga-ux-element=Hyperlink data-vars-ga-call-to-action=auction class="body-link css-1gunp80 emevuu60">auction</a>, with a pre-sale estimate of <a href=# data-vars-ga-outbound-link=https://www.barnebys.co.uk/blog/elizabeth-taylors-rediscovered-oscars-dress-goes-to-auction data-vars-ga-ux-element=Hyperlink data-vars-ga-call-to-action="£60,000 to £100,000." class="body-link css-1gunp80 emevuu60">£60,000 to £100,000.</a></p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=5 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">Marc Bohan designed the Siorée à Rio ‘Oscar’ dress for Dior's spring/summer 1961 collection. The striking creation featured a yellow bodice, a green taffeta belt with a red rose and a silk bubble skirt covered in embroidered flowers. This particular dress was one of Bohan’s earliest works for Dior in his role as creative director, having replaced Yves Saint Laurent in 1960.</p><img alt="britain us lifestyle film fashion sale" title=BRITAIN-US-LIFESTYLE-FILM-FASHION-SALE width=4752 height=4000 decoding=async data-nimg=1 sizes=100vw src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/hips.hearstapps.com/hmg-prod/images/an-employee-poses-with-a-christian-dior-dress-worn-by-news-photo-1702289611.jpg style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center><p><span class="css-1urwh1q e1geg53v2">Daniel Leal</span><span class="css-5ck6gj e1geg53v0">//</span><span class="css-1urwh1q e1geg53v1">Getty Images</span></p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=7 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">Taylor famously used to travel with 40 huge trunks of clothes, but eventually decided to give away her special Dior gown – alongside many other pieces – gifting the 'lucky' dress to close family friends Gaston and Elizabeth Sanz. Gaston Sanz had worked for Elizabeth Taylor since the 1950s and was one of her most trusted and longest-serving employees.</p><img alt="elizabeth taylor with oscar" title="Elizabeth Taylor With Oscar" width=1011 height=1024 decoding=async data-nimg=1 sizes=100vw src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/hips.hearstapps.com/hmg-prod/images/british-born-american-actress-elizabeth-taylor-with-her-news-photo-1702289003.jpg style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center><p><span class="css-1urwh1q e1geg53v2">Archive Photos</span><span class="css-5ck6gj e1geg53v0">//</span><span class="css-1urwh1q e1geg53v1">Getty Images</span></p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=9 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">In 2022, the Sanz family contacted Kerry Taylor Auctions to assess the value of Anne Sanz's collection of Taylor's clothes, kept in excellent condition in suitcases located in London. Other garments that will be sold alongside the gown include a Tiziani by Karl Lagerfeld couture cocktail dress, a Christian Dior couture by Marc Bohan blue silk crêpe piece, and her film-worn robe from Boom! designed by Karl Lagerfeld.</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=10 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">The collection will be auctioned on 12 December as part of <a href=# data-vars-ga-outbound-link="https://www.kerrytaylorauctions.com/auction/details/-passion-for-fashion/?au=120" data-vars-ga-ux-element=Hyperlink data-vars-ga-call-to-action="Kerry Taylor Auction's Passion for Fashion Sale.
