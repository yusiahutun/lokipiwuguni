It all started when <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=internalLink data-ordinal=2>The Devil Wears Prada</a>’s Miranda Priestly famously scoffed at an editor who suggested florals were going to be big for spring 2006. Hollywood’s most feared editor-in-chief deadpanned, unblinking, “groundbreaking,” and that was that. Florals were dubbed a painful cliche from there on out. But it’s not just spring flowers that get a bad rap; spring pastels are widely considered banal, too, which leaves us to ponder how to wear pastels in a way that isn’t so overdone.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_3-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">By definition, a pastel is a “soft and delicate” shade of a color.&nbsp;<a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=internalLink data-ordinal=1>Powdery blue</a> and yellow, baby pink, and muted hues of sage and violet come to mind. All are gorgeous, and yet they’re considered overly cutesy, kindred to children in their seasonal Sunday best. But does this mean spring pastels should be avoided?</p><figure id=mntl-sc-block_5-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block instyle-sc-block-image mntl-sc-block-universal-image mntl-sc-block-image--no-theme no-theme mntl-sc-block-image figure-portrait figure-high-res"><span class=figure-article-caption-owner><p>Getty Images</p></span></figure><span class=heading-toc id=toc-mix-instead-of-match></span><h2 id=mntl-sc-block_6-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block instyle-sc-block-heading mntl-sc-block-heading"><span class=mntl-sc-block-heading__text>Mix Instead of Match</span></h2><p id=mntl-sc-block_7-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">According to fashion stylist and style expert, Naina Singla, just because certain colors are expected to be worn in a given season, doesn’t mean they aren’t wearable. Nor do you have to style them any differently than the status quo, if the look is one you love and feel good in. However,&nbsp;Singla notes there are ways to “'break' this traditional mold,” should you want to switch things up.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_9-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">For example, pastels, though soft, can actually be quite aggressive. To offset their brightness, Singla suggests pairing your favorite pastel with a contrasting color — think blue, brown, or charcoal — so that the coupling can complement one another and change the entire finished look. Just keep in mind “this looks best when you choose just one contrasting color,” Singla clarifies, as “many competing colors in the outfit” can make it look too cluttered.</p><span class=heading-toc id=toc-reconsider-pastel-pieces></span><h2 id=mntl-sc-block_13-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block instyle-sc-block-heading mntl-sc-block-heading"><span class=mntl-sc-block-heading__text>Reconsider Pastel Pieces</span></h2><p id=mntl-sc-block_14-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">Because pastels are so strongly associated with youth, Singla also recommends wearing the softest versions of baby pink, mint green, and powder blue to evoke a more age-appropriate style that’s both delicate and feminine.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_16-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">“Try a powder blue utilitarian-style silk button-down blouse paired with mocha brown high-waisted straight-leg trousers, medium to dark brown ankle boots, a pair of statement sunglasses, a mini ice blue satchel, and you are all set for an easy polished look for spring. Another option is to wear a thin layered look composed of a short-sleeve camel crewneck sweater with mid-rise jeans and neutral-colored ballet flats. Simply throw on a long pale blue lightweight <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=internalLink data-ordinal=1>maxi sweater coat</a> over the top for added warmth, and you have a chic and comfortable look.”</p><figure id=mntl-sc-block_18-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block instyle-sc-block-image mntl-sc-block-universal-image mntl-sc-block-image--no-theme no-theme mntl-sc-block-image figure-portrait figure-high-res"><span class=figure-article-caption-owner><p>Getty Images</p></span></figure><span class=heading-toc id=toc-think-about-fabric></span><h2 id=mntl-sc-block_19-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block instyle-sc-block-heading mntl-sc-block-heading"><span class=mntl-sc-block-heading__text>Think About Fabric</span></h2><p id=mntl-sc-block_20-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">Beyond the clothing’s coloring, style therapist, <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=externalLink data-ordinal=1>Christina Stein</a> tells InStyle the fabrics and cuts you’re using also play a major role in how pastels are perceived. For example, wearing something adorned with lace, florals, and/or frills, she says, “can make the garment seem less sexy.” Instead, Stein proposes sporting pastels by way of monochromatic suits, or a <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=internalLink data-ordinal=2>pastel corset</a> with a pair of denim to “bring new life to these colors.”</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7qrrSrbClnV6YvK57x6iuZqyfYsSmrdFmp5qrpJq5bq%2FLqKuhoZ6cenh9lGtwbWo%3D</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./doen-black-friday-sale.html><span>←</span><span>Den's Cyber Monday Sale 2023 Details and 20 Best Deals</span></a>
