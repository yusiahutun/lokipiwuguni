Once you'd decided you wanted to invest, you needed an elaborate system installed around your home. Large sensors would monitor for movement in each room. Once the system was enabled, any activity in those areas would trigger an alarm.</p><p>Fortunately, technology has moved on. Smart Mimic took to the virtual floor at CES 2021 to showcase the Mimic GO, a portable motion detecting alarm.</p><strong class=ad-zone-advertising-tag></strong><h2 id=what-is-the-mimic-go>What Is the Mimic GO?</h2><p>The Mimic GO is a small motion-detecting alarm for securing your home and belongings. The palm-sized device is equipped with color-changing LEDs and can be easily attached to most surfaces and items. The white circular protrusion on the front of the unit houses the motion-detecting sensors.</p><p>Once enabled, any movement within the Mimic GO's range will trigger an alarm. The device has a three-month battery life, is water and dust-resistant, and is suitable for indoor and outdoor use. When triggered, the Mimic GO emits a 120dB alarm, which can be deactivated via the Mimic smartphone app.</p><strong class=ad-zone-advertising-tag></strong><p>It doesn't require Wi-Fi, a SIM card, or a cell network. Instead, the Mimic GO is connected to the LoRa network, a wide-area wireless network developed with the Internet of Things and smart gadgets in mind.</p><h2 id=mimic-go-features>Mimic GO Features</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static1.makeuseofimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/Mimic_GO.png><p>Once you've unpacked your Mimic GO, you can head to your smartphone's app store and download the Mimic app. The GO syncs to your phone via a wireless Bluetooth 5.0 connection.</p><p>Using the app, it's possible to change settings, adjust the LEDs, and select a mode. The mode adjusts the onboard sensors depending on the situation and location you're using the GO in. For instance, there are modes for Belongings, Door, and Presence.</p><strong class=ad-zone-advertising-tag></strong><p>If none of these quite suits you, you can create a custom mode within the app. Notably, the Mimic GO is one of the more privacy-focused alarms out there. There are no onboard cameras, location trackers, GPS sensors, or microphones.</p><h2 id=where-can-you-buy-the-mimic-go>Where Can You Buy the Mimic GO?</h2><p>The <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Mimic GO</a> is available directly from the company's website. A single unit retails for $89.90, while a five-pack costs $349.90. Although the Mimic GO is the most recent Smart Mimic device, the company previously released the Mimic Track.</p><strong class=ad-zone-advertising-tag></strong><p>This physically larger unit is better-suited to tracking high-value items like cars, bikes, motorcycles, and even boats. For those interested, you'll need to inquire about the <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Mimic Track</a> on the Smart Mimic website.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7rq3KnqysnZ%2Bbe6S7zGikoqWZmHqou4yppquskZe5pnnApZirpV8%3D</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./technical-director-john-morling-urges-hong-kong-emulate-world-cup-surprise-packages-wants-coach-jorn.html><span>←</span><span>Technical director John Morling urges Hong Kong to emulate World Cup surprise packages, wants coach</span></a>
