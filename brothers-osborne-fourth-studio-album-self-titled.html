"And doing that reminded me of what it was like when I first started playing music, when it was an outlet for my angst or just a way to have fun.”</p><p>"Since our last record, we’ve been very forthcoming with who we are," John Osborne adds. "By acknowledging TJ’s personal life and my mental-health struggles, we are more ourselves creatively and publicly than we’ve ever been.” (TJ Osborne <a href=#>came out as gay</a> in an interview with Time in January of 2021).</p><p>The Grammy, ACM and CMA Award-winning duo enlisted producer Mike Elizondo for the new tracks, and he put together a band of studio musicians for the sessions that includes Paul McCartney's drummer, Abe Laboriel Jr.</p><p><a href=#>Miranda Lambert</a> co-wrote a song titled "We Ain't Good at Breaking Up" alongside the brothers and Jesse Frasure, and she also sings guest vocals on the track. TJ and John Osborne co-wrote every song on the project, working with more of the top songwriters in Nashville, including Casey Beathard, Corey Crowder, Jessie Jo Dillon, Jaren Johnston and more.</p><p>The duo will launch the new project with four special new shows in New York City, Los Angeles, Washington, D.C., and Nashville in October.</p><p>“These four shows will be very special and all will be different, showcasing music from our new album, and of course some of your old favorites," they state.</p><p>Brothers Osborne is <a href=#>currently available for pre-order, pre-add and pre-save across a wide variety of formats</a>.
