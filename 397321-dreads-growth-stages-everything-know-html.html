This will help you apply the right maintenance tips at each stage to help you achieve the best results with your hair. This could be the difference between enjoying healthy locs, or being thoroughly frustrated with them.</p><h2>Dreads growth stages</h2><p class=align-left>Dreadlocks are a preferred hairstyle among many people due to their versatility and flexibility. However, at their initial stages, they require a lot of attention and high-maintenance.</p><a class=c-article-read-also__image-wrapper href=#><img sizes=256px style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/netstorage-tuko.akamaized.net/images/619927f80b919c6f.jpg></a><a class=c-article-read-also__headline href=# readability=27><p class=c-article-read-also__caption>Read also</p><p class=c-article-read-also__headline-wrapper><span class=c-article-read-also__headline-hover-inner>20+ best low-cut hairstyles for ladies with natural hair</span></p></a><p class=align-left>Once you get through the early phases, you are bound to enjoy this look for a long period of time. Below are the loc stages by month. The stages of dreads pictures will guide you as you go through each phase.</p><h3>Starter stage: 3-6 months</h3><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/netstorage-tuko.akamaized.net/images/619927f80b919c6f.jpg><p class=align-left>This starting phase is also referred to as the baby stage. At the starter stage, you get to create a parting pattern for your locs. It is advisable that the hair sections are not too small, as they can easily break. This is also the budding stage for locs, and they can form anywhere along the hair strand.</p><p class=align-left>Some of the characteristics of the locs at this point are that they are small in size, neat, and have clean parts. The growth of the hair at this point depends on the hair type. To maintain the locs during this phase, try to wait at least two weeks before your first shampoo wash.</p><a class=c-article-read-also__image-wrapper href=#><img sizes=256px style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/netstorage-tuko.akamaized.net/images/400ed8f04b366e97.jpg></a><a class=c-article-read-also__headline href=# readability=29><p class=c-article-read-also__caption>Read also</p><p class=c-article-read-also__headline-wrapper><span class=c-article-read-also__headline-hover-inner>20 best braided wigs hairstyles, designs, and ideas in 2021</span></p></a><p class=align-left>It is also advisable to use residue-free shampoo when you wash your hair and to keep the locs moisturized by applying conditioner daily. Also, do not de-entangle your dreads, and let them grow without disturbance.</p><h3>Budding stage: 6-12 months</h3><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/netstorage-tuko.akamaized.net/images/56e6faa5dc6d59f2.jpg><p class=align-left>The budding stage is also known as the sprouting phase. How long does it take for locs to bud? The period of time taken is determined by the hair type, as some locs grow faster than others. The original partings should be maintained to allow each strand to be established as the hair spins. It is also crucial to ensure that enough holding product is used during re-twisting.</p><p class=align-left>''How do you tell if your locs are growing?'' You will notice the new growth being puffy and swelled up. The coils will also start showing some thickness. This is an exciting phase for dreadlocks' growth as many people look forward to having long, flowing dreads.</p><a class=c-article-read-also__image-wrapper href=#><img sizes=256px style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/netstorage-tuko.akamaized.net/images/270883cd0cdad56b.jpg></a><a class=c-article-read-also__headline href=# readability=29><p class=c-article-read-also__caption>Read also</p><p class=c-article-read-also__headline-wrapper><span class=c-article-read-also__headline-hover-inner>20 best invisible braids hairstyles, designs, ideas 2021</span></p></a><p class=align-left>During shampooing and retwisting, less of the hair coils become undone. This makes it easier to groom the hair. At the budding stage, it is important that you practice a light retwisting routine, which helps promote new growth. Avoid overdoing it, as this can lead to hair thinning and breakage.</p><h3>Teenage stage: 12-15 months</h3><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/netstorage-tuko.akamaized.net/images/400ed8f04b366e97.jpg><p class=align-left>One of the common questions for people curious about their dreadlock progression timeline is, ''How long should dreads be after a year?'' Due to the different hair types, it is not easy to give a specific length that should be achieved within 12 months.</p><p class=align-left>The teen stage also referred to as the ''Ugly stage'' or the ''locking stage'' is characterized by locs that are fully formed, and are double the original size. The hair is not too long, and not too short, which is why some people refer to the locs as ugly at this point. One way to manage this is to have them all held together, and also be patient with your hair.</p><a class=c-article-read-also__image-wrapper href=#><img sizes=256px style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/netstorage-tuko.akamaized.net/images/994909ab7614347b.jpg></a><a class=c-article-read-also__headline href=# readability=27><p class=c-article-read-also__caption>Read also</p><p class=c-article-read-also__headline-wrapper><span class=c-article-read-also__headline-hover-inner>20+ Ghana weaving styles for oval face</span></p></a><p class=align-left>As the hair plumps and develops in form, you may feel like it is not growing lengthwise. This dreadlocks shrinking stage is because the locs are becoming denser and are tangling on the inside. One important maintenance tip at this level is to experiment using different pressure hairstyles to control some swelling. Also, wash and moisturize your hair regularly.</p><h3>Mature phase: 15-18 months</h3><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/netstorage-tuko.akamaized.net/images/a2678947c57d6620.jpg><p class=align-left>The mature stage is characterized by your locs being long enough to lie flat or hang down. They are firm and are not reforming much anymore. Looser hair textures take longer to get to this point. Hence, they require a little more patience. The time your hair takes to get here also depends on your hair care regimen.</p><p class=align-left>The dreads, at this point, are also thick enough to support themselves and do not require to be re-twisted often. They continue to grow in size and length. You can continue with your established regular shampooing and conditioning routine.
