It’s time to take a stand. Avoid sitting to improve your health and unlock a few extra potential benefits. Here's everything you need to consider about gaming standing up.</p><h2 id=the-dangers-of-sitting>The Dangers of Sitting</h2><p>Sedentary behavior like sitting for prolonged periods is linked to an increased risk of obesity, diabetes, cardiovascular disease, and cancer. You’ll find this mentioned in articles from reputable institutions like <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Harvard Health Publishing</a>, <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Yale Medicine</a>, and <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">WebMD</a> that should help motivate you to spend less time sat down and more time on your feet.</p><p>In addition to conditions that can lead to an earlier death, prolonged sitting may cause back pain and spinal issues (especially if you don’t have <a href=#>a good ergonomic chair</a>). Nobody expects you to spend all of your waking hours bolt upright or on a treadmill, but consciously reducing the time you spend sitting down can have health benefits.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong> <img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static1.howtogeekimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2022/02/branch-office-chair.jpg><p>Standing can burn more energy, promote better circulation, and prevent you from hunching, which leads to postural problems. Standing isn’t going to magically cause you to get into shape (as noted in one <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Harvard article</a>) since it only burns marginally more calories per hour than sitting. That said, reducing the time spent sitting down reduces your risk of conditions associated with sitting.</p><p>Though you’re probably well aware of the concept of using a standing desk at work or choosing to stand for your morning train journey, you might not have realized that many of your existing hobbies work just as well in a standing position as they do seated. This is especially true of video games.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=the-benefits-of-playing-games-standing-up>The Benefits of Playing Games Standing Up</h2><p>If you’re a keen gamer, you’re probably aware of how quickly time can fly when you’re having fun. Getting wrapped up in a story, trying to beat a high score, or working with a team in multiplayer can consume an entire evening. If you ditch your gamer chair, you might not even notice that you’re standing.</p><p>Standing can make you feel more alert, especially if you’re used to playing on the sofa or late at night. You won’t fall into the trap of slouching for hours only to realize your mistake when it’s too late. I find that I’m more aware of the passage of time when I play standing up. There’s something about being able to “feel” the effort you’re putting in, even if you’re standing still.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static1.howtogeekimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2023/11/87pvgm-transformed.jpeg> <strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>On top of this, it’s nice to be able to move around a bit while you’re playing to burn off any additional energy. This can often manifest in a kind of nervous, unconscious energy, especially during multiplayer sessions. Don’t reach for the fidget cube, do a lap of your living room instead.</p><p>Let’s not kid ourselves: the main reason to play standing up is to lead a less sedentary lifestyle. While many of us are keen to adjust our work routines to incorporate more activity, it’s not always so easy when it comes to our time off. This is doubly true if you already spend all day on your feet.</p><p>Just switching an hour per day of your gaming time to incorporate more standing is a start. Speaking from experience: it can take a little bit of getting used to, but eventually it’ll feel completely normal.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=standing-in-your-living-room>Standing in Your Living Room</h2><p>It’s arguably easier to make the switch to standing if you’re a console gamer. Modern consoles use wireless controllers that are designed for handheld use. The TV in your living room is probably big enough that you can see it from a comfortable standing distance, even if it means standing behind the chair or sofa you normally use.</p><p>Still, there are some challenges you might need to overcome. If your TV is placed especially low, standing might be a bit uncomfortable (though you should eventually get used to it). If you’re one of those “battle position” multiplayer gamers who leans forward when things get real, you won’t be able to do that while standing. If you game with a headset then you’ll either need to make sure you’ve set up wireless correctly or plug your headset into your controller where supported.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong> <img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static1.howtogeekimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2023/11/nintendo_switch_green_pink.jpg><p>If you play a lot of handheld games on your Switch or Steam Deck, you might have to get used to holding the weight of your console. For Switch owners, an ergonomic <a href=#>Joy-Con replacement like the HORI Split Pad Pro</a> can make things more comfortable for longer periods.</p><p>You might also get some odd looks from anyone who catches you willingly standing next to a nice comfortable couch while playing games. People might think you’re weird for doing this, but we think you’re brave and inspirational.</p><h2 id=pc-gamers-should-get-standing-desks>PC Gamers Should Get Standing Desks</h2><p>The standing desk craze came and never seemed to go away. There is no shortage of standing desks in IKEA and office supply stores, including fancy ones with powered lifting mechanisms that convert at the touch of a button. This makes them incredibly versatile investments in your health.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>For PC gamers, <a href=#>standing desks make for compelling purchases</a>. With some clever cable management, you can make sure that your monitor, peripherals, and even PC case has room to move with you as you switch between seated and standing positions. With the tap of a button, a whole streaming setup can move with you, including any camera-mounted tripods, lights, microphones, and controller peripherals you happen to use.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static1.howtogeekimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/branch-duo-standing-desk.jpg><p>A standing desk is great for work and play and doesn’t have to cost the earth. <a href=#>Standing desks come in all sorts of varieties</a>, from cheaper hand-cranked models to fancy powered ones. If you already have a desk you may be able to convert it into a standing desk with a riser. Alternatively, you can buy one of the <a href=#>best standing desks</a> instead.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=forming-healthier-gaming-habits>Forming Healthier Gaming Habits</h2><p>There’s no reason gaming has to be an unhealthy habit. Many games are social pursuits, others engage your brain and encourage problem-solving, while others improve reflexes and hand-to-eye coordination. Arguably the least healthy aspect of playing video games is that the hobby is often seen as sedentary.</p><p>But that doesn’t need to be the case. So rise up out of your seat and lower your risk of poor health outcomes. Be aware that there’s an adjustment period, and you might want to wear some nice comfy indoor shoes with plenty of arch support while you do this.</p><p>If you find that standing up playing games isn’t enough, why not check out <a href=#>the wonderful world of fitness video games instead</a>?</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7qbvWraagnZWge6S7zGiuobFdrry2edKhpq6klGK9ra3YZq2inJWkeqitzJ6qZquklrultc2gZK6oXw%3D%3D</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./article-c0dcae98-c136-11ea-a1f9-430134c444f4-html.html><span>←</span><span>Randy Lynn Rivers | Obituaries</span></a>
