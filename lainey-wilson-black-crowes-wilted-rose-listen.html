The country singer — who has been a fan of the rock band for years — is the first non-Crowe to be featured on one of their tracks ... ever.</p><p>"Wilted Rose" is a classic Southern rock ballad with soulful guitar lines that blur the lines between country and rock 'n' roll. Wilson's harmony blends effortlessly with those of the band's frontman, <a href=#>Chris Robinson</a>.</p><h3>How Did Lainey Wilson End Up on a Black Crowes Song?</h3><p>Wilson's collaborations with the Crowes is a historic moment&nbsp;since the band has never featured another artist on their music before. There was something special about the country singer that grabbed their attention after a <a href=#>chance meeting</a> at the 2023 CMT Music Awards.</p><p>"She was such a sweetheart and she was like, 'Oh my god, I grew up listening to the Black Crowes,'" Robinsons tells <a href=#>Loudwire Nights</a>'&nbsp;Chuck Armstrong. "We just had a little moment in between interviews and whatever ... (Producer Jay Joyce) asked her and she just did it."</p><p>The Black Crowes were at the awards show to perform a special rendition of "She Talks to Angels" with <a href=#>Darius Rucker</a>.</p><p>"I was in L.A., it was kind of after the main part of the record and we heard it and were like, 'Wow,'" Robinson says of Wilson's recording. "I mean, of course, she's incredibly talented and she's having her superstar moment."</p><p>"We're really happy for her and she's going to go on and do great things. She's already doing it."</p><h3>Here&nbsp;Are the Black Crowes' "Wilted Rose" Lyrics&nbsp;Feat. Lainey Wilson</h3><p>It is time to say farewell / Now the black horse has come / It is time to lay your guns down / And raise your hands to the sun / With all your arrows broken / Your fate sealed with a kiss / They've gathered all the suspects / But there's one that they missed</p><p>Chorus:</p><p>She held a wilted rose / Under a darkening sky / She held a wilted rose / Crying when I looked behind</p><p>Nothing left but dust / And the narrowing way / Now there's no one to trust / And you like it that way / Like a snake in the water, yeah / That stays underneath / Ready to poison / From between her teeth</p><p><strong>Repeat Chorus</strong></p><p>Hear her cry, I can hear her cry / Oh, yeah, yeah / Oh-oh, oh-oh-oh</p><p><strong>Repeat Chorus</strong></p><h2 class=photogallery-title>These Cute Pics of Lainey Wilson + Devlin Hodges Are Workin' Overtime</h2><p>Slowly, but surely, Lainey Wilson is becoming more comfortable sharing her relationship with former NFL player Devlin Hodges with the world. Although it's unclear when their romance began, the pair made their first pubic appearance together at the 2023 ACM Awards. Then, they attended the CMA Awards together that fall.</p><p>Wilson has spoken very little about Hodges, but she did share that she's not afraid to put him to work around her home in Nashville.</p>"I put him to work," Wilson told <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Taste of Country</a> ahead of the&nbsp;2023 CMA Awards. "Look, he's got a long list of things. I'm like, 'Take the trash out, mow the yard, do something with the flower beds, feed the dogs.'"<p>One things is for sure, these two make an adorable couple.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmiskajBprvFnKaupqSnxm%2BvzqZmpZmZo7K6edaio6ynnmKvra3CpGScqp%2BssrR51qKjrZ2UYr%2Bwv8Rmo6KrpJq7cA%3D%3D</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./kristen-stewart-brushes-topless-scenes-new-film-on-road-html.html><span>←</span><span>Kristen Stewart brushes off topless scenes in new film On the Road</span></a>
