Jurors reached their verdict after deliberating for less than two hours on Wednesday, the South Florida Sun-Sentinel reported.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">The jury’s verdict form allotted US$400,000 in damages for the past four years, and another US$400,000 for the future from the McDonald’s USA and its franchise operator, Upchurch Foods. A separate jury decided in May that the company and franchise owner were liable for the injury, which occurred outside a McDonald’s in Tamarac, near Fort Lauderdale.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">“I’m actually just happy that they listened to Olivia’s voice and the jury was able to decide a fair judgment,” Olivia’s mother, Philana Holmes, told reporters outside the courtroom. “I’m happy with that. I honestly had no expectations, so this is more than fair for me.”</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/cdn.i-scmp.com/sites/default/files/d8/images/canvas/2023/07/21/0c0b2876-0ef6-4f06-b38c-7ddd0a5d096a_595de0ff.jpg><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">She testified on Tuesday that Olivia, now eight, calls the scar on her inner thigh her “nugget” and is fixated on having it removed, the newspaper reported.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">Lawyers for McDonald’s argued that the child’s discomfort ended when the wound healed, which they said took about three weeks. They contended that the girl’s mother is the one who has the problem with the scar, and told jurors that US$156,000 should cover damages, both past and future.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">“She’s still going to McDonald's, she still asks to go to McDonald’s, she’s still driving through the drive-through with her mom, getting chicken nuggets,” defence lawyer Jennifer Miller said in her closing argument Wednesday. “She’s not bothered by the injury. This is all the mom.”</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">Defence lawyers declined to speak after the verdict.</p><h3 type=h3 data-qa=Component-Component class="e14khtrb0 css-17x7qa9 e793b7w1"><a class="link-text css-e0dnmk ef1hf1w0" href=# data-qa=BaseLink-renderAnchor-StyledAnchor><p><span data-qa=DigitalArchiveLink-TitleText class="css-66qo9a eeeqn932">Chicken nuggets order led police to Facebook video murderer</span></p></a></h3><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">Holmes testified that she had bought Happy Meals for her son and daughter, who was sitting in the back seat, and was driving away when the nugget fell on the child’s leg. She said that the girl screamed in pain, and when she pulled over in a car park, she realised the nugget was lodged between Oliva’s thigh and the seat belt.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">The mother testified that at no point did McDonald’s warn her the food might be unusually hot. The company testified they follow food safety rules, which require McNuggets to be hot enough to avoid salmonella poisoning, and that what happens with the food once it leaves the drive-through window is beyond their control.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">While both sides agreed during the trial in May that the nugget caused the burns, the family’s lawyers argued the temperature was above 93 degrees Celsius (200 degrees Fahrenheit), while the defence said it was no more than 71 degrees Celsius (160 degrees Fahrenheit).</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">Photos the mother took of the burn and sound clips of the child’s screams were played in court.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/cdn.i-scmp.com/sites/default/files/d8/images/canvas/2023/07/21/d2ddd90f-bbd9-4bf8-b551-d35b4ab671f0_595de0ff.jpg><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">The case may stoke memories of the McDonald’s coffee lawsuit of the 1990s, which became an urban legend of sorts about seemingly frivolous lawsuits, even though a jury and judge had found it anything but.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">A New Mexico jury awarded Stella Liebeck, 81, US$2.7 million in punitive damages after she was scalded in 1992 by hot coffee from McDonald’s that spilled onto her lap, burning her legs, groin and buttocks, as she tried to steady the cup with her legs while prying the lid off to add cream outside a drive-through.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">She suffered third-degree burns and spent more than a week in hospital.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">She had initially asked McDonald’s for US$20,000 to cover hospital expenses, but the company went to trial. A judge later reduced the US$2.7 million award to US$480,000, which he said was appropriate for the “wilful, wanton, reckless” and “callous” behaviour by McDonald’s.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tK%2FMqWWcp51ku6bD0miuqKqcmXy2usitnJ1lo6mutbHSZpqappGZrnCt0a2gnKSVZIBzfpdtZ3BnnZixsLrApZusZZ2qwLV5z5qwZq2jbX1xfI9pZK6rXZy2s7iMm6yrppWZeqm702aaoaGToLKvecycpa6fl5rB</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./sheena-halili-and-rainier-castillo.html><span>←</span><span>Sheena Halili and Rainier Castillo</span></a>
