Selton Miguel added 13 points off the bench and Kobe Knox had 12 points as the Bulls stretched their winning streak to 14 games. South Florida (22-5, 15-1 AAC) shot 48.2 percent from the floor and pulled in 15 offensive rebounds in another impressive showing for first-year coach Amir Abdur-Rahim's team. This marks the first time the Bulls have captured a regular-season league title. Lu'cye Patterson's 17 points led Charlotte (17-11, 11-5), while Nik Graves had 12 points and Dean Reiber posted 11 points. The 49ers couldn't overcome their 40.4 percent shooting from the floor. They made just 5 of 18 shots from 3-point range. Youngblood drained a 3-pointer and Miguel made two free throws as the lead grew to 60-44 as the midway mark of the second half approached. The Bulls feasted on more free throws before Youngblood's 3 quieted the crowd again to give South Florida a 67-49 advantage. Even with Charlotte scoring the next seven points, the 49ers didn't put together a sustained run because they didn't string together enough scoring possessions. South Florida withstood a stretch of scoring only three points in more than four minutes, yet still held a double-digit advantage. The Bulls led 33-28 at halftime and stretched that to 46-35 early in the second half. South Florida, which already achieved its first 20-win regular season in program history, swept the season series from Charlotte. Youngblood finished 6-for-10 from the floor with three 3s. The Bulls outrebounded the 49ers 42-28. Brandon Stroud had 10 of the boards. --Field Level Media</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7rbHAnZyrZZOWua16wqikaKugpL%2B1v46nmK2hn6OurXvNqGRrbV2qwKd506inrGWTna6zuM6tq55lpKR6uLXNZpiam12nsqjBy5qpZquVlsCwuoytoK2klWSus8DInKOel2hmfXeBkZ1vZmqVZ7NugZGcamZxZWuubn3AbppsaGCbgXh%2BxGefraWc</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./nicola-peltz-topless-photo-brooklyn-reacts.html><span>←</span><span>Brooklyn Beckham has the best reaction to fiance Nicola Peltz's risky topless picture</span></a>
