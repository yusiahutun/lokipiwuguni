This figure is somewhat lower than in previous years, for example in 2014 it was&nbsp;<a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">&nbsp;7.71</a>, almost 2.5 times more. This is due to a number of different factors, the economy, interest rates, the&nbsp;pandemic. But, in the long run, is it more economical buying a brand-new car than a used one?&nbsp;</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading>In the following article, we’re going to take a closer look at the benefits of buying a brand-new car.</h2><p>Along the way, we’ll check out the benefits, or disadvantages, of maintaining your current model.</p><h3 class=wp-block-heading>1. Reliability</h3><p>Technology moves fast, and the automobile industry has witnessed a sea change in vehicle technology in the past decade. Now, you might not be too concerned about what’s going on under the hood, but you won’t be worrying about anything going wrong either. For some, the peace of mind that comes with purchasing a new automobile is priceless.</p><h3 class=wp-block-heading>2. Driving down&nbsp;costs</h3><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/theenterpriseworld.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/15.-Driving-down-costs.jpg><p>These days, modern car engines are more economical than ever, regardless of whether you’re running on gas, diesel, or electricity. And while we’re on the subject of driving, new cars are now much&nbsp;<a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">safer</a>&nbsp;to drive than used cars. For parents especially, you can’t put a price on safety. Therefore safety is one of the important factors in the list of benefits of buying a brand-new car.</p><h3 class=wp-block-heading>3. Design</h3><p>A new car doesn’t just mean you’re buying into state-of-the-art technology, your car will look as good as it goes. And by ‘looking good’ you can have your new ride tweaked to your very own personal tastes with things like window tints, wraps, and even&nbsp;<a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">private number plates</a>. For fashionistas this is a no-brainer, for the rest of us, it’s pretty clear-cut as well. I mean, who wants to look like last season’s laundry?</p><h3 class=wp-block-heading>4. Old versus New</h3><p>Used cars of a certain age might not be covered by a manufacturer or dealer warranty. And that’s before we’ve even started on longevity, hidden damage, sharp practice etc., especially used cars with more than one previous owner. To say things can get very expensive if things go wrong is somewhat of an understatement. Buy new and this all goes away.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><h3 class=wp-block-heading>5. Living with your new car</h3><p>Of course, even a new car is going to need a service at some point, the average time is about&nbsp;twelve months,&nbsp;and many manufacturers offer this for&nbsp;free. You’re going to need new tires at some point soon but shop around and you can cut costs and upgrade at the same time.&nbsp;<a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">Nitto tires</a>, for example, offer a wide range of performance tires to fit a multitude of wheel sizes.</p><h3 class=wp-block-heading>6. It’s not just&nbsp;tires</h3><p>You can&nbsp;upgrade&nbsp;your <a href=#>new car</a> with a better braking system or maybe modify the exhaust system. Even simple changes such as swapping out rubber hoses for silicone ones will make a difference, but always start with the tires. After all, these are the only part of the car that makes direct contact with the road.</p><h3 class=wp-block-heading>7. Trade in your old car</h3><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/theenterpriseworld.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/15.-Trade-in-your-old-car.jpg><p>You could save money when trading old for new, but you might even be able to save money in the car showroom itself. Firstly, know what you want before you enter the showroom, be polite and confident and remember, you’re dealing with a&nbsp;salesperson&nbsp;first and foremost.&nbsp;</p><h3 class=wp-block-heading>8. Best new models for 2023</h3><p>For under 10k you can pick up a brand-new&nbsp;Kia Picanto, if you’ve got 15k you can get behind the wheel of a Volkswagen Up or a Hyundai i10. The choice of models really starts to open up at 20k or above. Here a range of anything from hybrids to high-performance sports cars is at your disposal, so set a budget and choose wisely.</p><p>We hope we’ve gone some way to demonstrating that holding on to your old ride might not be beneficial for your wallet and what are the benefits of buying a brand-new car, personal safety or even your state of mind! And it’d be remiss of us to ignore the harmful effect your old banger might be having on the environment too. Food for thought, that.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmismJqyr8DEq6eroaOaxLC%2By51lnKedZK%2BmusSfoK2rXaSzbq7UsqCnn12WeqO%2BwKebZqaVrHqkrdE%3D</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./southern-china-still-lashed-heavy-rains-triggering-second-flood-alert-many-days.html><span>←</span><span>Southern China still lashed by heavy rains, triggering second flood alert in as many days</span></a>
