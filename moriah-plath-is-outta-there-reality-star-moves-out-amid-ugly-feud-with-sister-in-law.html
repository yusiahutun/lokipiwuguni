I am so over it. I’m just tired of fragile relationships.</p><p>“If you have to constantly walk on eggshells around somebody’s feelings, if you spend three to four years of your life trying to make that person happy and then you make one decision that doesn’t make ’em happy and it affects your whole relationship?</p><p>“That’s not a true friend.”</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2022/05/moriah-plath-on-the-premiere-1.png><p>Not long after this episode aired, <a href=#>Moriah appeared to hurl shade at Olivia</a> on social media.</p><p>On her Instagram Stories on August 2, Moriah shared a quote from what she cited was @selflessquotes. It read as follows:</p><p><strong>you cannot heal a person who keeps using their pain as an excuse to hurt you. READ THAT AGAIN</strong></p><p>Moriah didn’t cite Olivia by name — but she later did so as part of a statement released by her and her siblings.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2022/02/thg-black.jpg><p>In a shocking message posted a couple weeks ago, Moriah and company wrote:</p><p>“We as a family have decided to not be divided anymore.</p><p>“There is a lot more to the story than what you all have seen on the show.</p><p>“While we understand that this is a TV show and we are not in control how the show is edited, we are actually a family that is full of love and respect for each other.</p><p>“That being said, we as a family are not going to sit back and watch as our family is driven apart.”</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2021/10/ethan-and-olivia-plath-on-camera.png><p>This statement seemed to be in response to the August 4 installment of Welcome to Plathville… during which Olivia alleged that her mother-in-law, Kim Plath, used her son’s credit card years ago without permission.</p><p>The 24-year old further claimed that her long-time rival stole from Ethan.</p><p>After Olivia confronted her husband about what happened, Olivia said her spouse didn’t know his password to revoke his mom’s access.</p><p>Olivia relayed this tale to make Kim look back… but Kim’s children are now saying their mother was painted with an unfair and incomplete brush in this instance.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2022/02/thg-black.jpg><p>“Mom and Ethan had a business agreement in which Ethan earned a good bit of money. And both parties were aware of any transactions that were made,” Moriah and her brothers and sisters wrote in their message.</p><p>“Our mom should have had the opportunity to defend herself and tell her side of the story.”</p><p>The posting went on:</p><p>“Some of us kids have been rebels and are finding our place in life and are very thankful to be supported and unconditionally loved by our family… no matter what choices we make or who we become</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src><p>The Plath Family rose to fame in November 2019 upon premiere of their TLC reality program.</p><p>It chronicles Kim and Barry Plath‘s lives as parents of NINE kids — they share Ethan, Hosanna, Micah, Moriah, Lydia, Isaac, Amber, Cassia and Mercy — in rural Georgia.</p><p>The large brood, who used to be part of their own band, live remotely with strict rules. Including no television viewing nor drinking of soda.</p><p>Such strict guidelines have caused a problem for Olivia, as she’s encouraged Ethan to break free from his mom and dad ever since they started dating.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2022/02/thg-black.jpg><p>“Please remember that we are human and do make mistakes. Nobody is perfect and we continue to learn and grow with everyday. Not one person is at fault,” wrote the siblings in this new statement.</p><p>“We also have younger siblings that are at very vulnerable ages and this is not fair nor healthy for them. We’ve come to the realization that unless we speak up this cycle will never end.</p><p>“We ask that you have compassion for us and understand that not everything you see on the show is as it actually is in real life.”</p><p>“In their message, the younger Plaths thanked fans for their support and concluded:</p><p><strong>Family first.</strong></p><p>Presumably, in their mind, this family no longer includes Olivia Plath.</p><ul class="dpsp-networks-btns-wrapper dpsp-networks-btns-share dpsp-networks-btns-content dpsp-column-auto dpsp-has-button-icon-animation" style=padding:0;margin:0;list-style-type:none><li class="dpsp-network-list-item dpsp-network-list-item-facebook" style=float:left><a rel="nofollow noopener" href=# class="dpsp-network-btn dpsp-facebook dpsp-no-label dpsp-first" aria-label="Share on Facebook" title="Share on Facebook" style=font-size:14px;padding:0;max-height:40px><span class=dpsp-network-icon><span class=dpsp-network-icon-inner></span></span></a></li><li class="dpsp-network-list-item dpsp-network-list-item-twitter" style=float:left><a rel="nofollow noopener" href=# class="dpsp-network-btn dpsp-twitter dpsp-no-label" aria-label="Share on Twitter" title="Share on Twitter" style=font-size:14px;padding:0;max-height:40px><span class=dpsp-network-icon><span class=dpsp-network-icon-inner></span></span></a></li><li class="dpsp-network-list-item dpsp-network-list-item-email" style=float:left><a rel="nofollow noopener" href=# class="dpsp-network-btn dpsp-email dpsp-no-label" aria-label="Send over email" title="Send over email" style=font-size:14px;padding:0;max-height:40px><span class=dpsp-network-icon><span class=dpsp-network-icon-inner></span></span></a></li><li class="dpsp-network-list-item dpsp-network-list-item-reddit" style=float:left><a rel="nofollow noopener" href=# class="dpsp-network-btn dpsp-reddit dpsp-no-label dpsp-last" aria-label="Share on Reddit" title="Share on Reddit" style=font-size:14px;padding:0;max-height:40px><span class=dpsp-network-icon><span class=dpsp-network-icon-inner></span></span></a></li></ul><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tbTEoaalpKmsvLCwxqiqrKGgY7CwuY5rZ2tqX2WFcLnOq6CaoF2luaLAx2agrGWfqsG1rYytn56qlWK%2Fpq3LoquyZaOprrN5zKitnqtdpMK1ecCmoJ1lpZy5unnFnqydZaeewal50qKqrZ2iYravecuarmg%3D</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./borsa-primavera-estate-2024-stella-mccartney-vintage.html><span>←</span><span>La borsa vintage must have Primavera 2024 di Stella McCartney</span></a>
