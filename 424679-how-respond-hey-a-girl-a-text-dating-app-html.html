First, the three letters, ordinarily, aren't the ideal way of starting a conversation in most instances.</p><p class=align-left>However, the simple word is used globally to initiate talks in the most awkward situations. So, if the term will break the ice and allow you to communicate with your crush on a dating site, why not take advantage by learning how to respond?</p><a class=c-article-read-also__image-wrapper href=#><img sizes=256px style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/netstorage-tuko.akamaized.net/images/e3a882847d8dab6e.jpeg></a><a class=c-article-read-also__headline href=# readability=27><p class=c-article-read-also__caption>Read also</p><p class=c-article-read-also__headline-wrapper><span class=c-article-read-also__headline-hover-inner>50+ posing quotes and captions for your Instagram photos</span></p></a><h2>How to respond to ‘Hey’ from a girl</h2><p class=align-left>Are you wondering what to say when a girl texts you 'Hey'? Traditionally, men are expected to initiate a conversation. Unfortunately, the <a href=# rel="nofollow noopener">cultural habit</a> has persisted into the online <a href=# title>dating</a> universe.</p><p class=align-left>Therefore, getting the first message from a girl sounds strange for most people, as the woman sets the initial tone and expectation for a conversation.</p><p class=align-left>However, if you are unfortunate to get the generic, 'Hey,' you might wrack your brain trying to figure out the ideal way to respond. So, why is it hard to respond to such a <a href=#>message</a>?</p><p class=align-left>First, the three-letter word is vague as it doesn't give one the flow they ought to expect from a conversation. Second, it is the texting equivalent to a nod of the head. The person is opening the door for you to chat, but you are responsible for <a href=# rel="nofollow noopener">continuing the conversation</a>.</p><a class=c-article-read-also__image-wrapper href=#><img sizes=256px style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/netstorage-tuko.akamaized.net/images/f39ac4e902a235e4.jpg></a><a class=c-article-read-also__headline href=# readability=27><p class=c-article-read-also__caption>Read also</p><p class=c-article-read-also__headline-wrapper><span class=c-article-read-also__headline-hover-inner>My girlfriend has a celebrity crush: Should I be worried?</span></p></a><p class=align-left>The term is universally seen as annoying rather than flattering, but what else would you expect a stranger to say during their first interaction. Also, remember that most people are new to online dating and consider the term a real conversation starter, which is applicable in the real <a href=#>world</a>. So, how can you reply to a 'Hey' text from a girl?</p><h3>Give them a taste of their own medicine</h3><p class=align-left>One of the best responses to the 'Hey' text is responding with 'Hey' back. You can even tweak the response to include more words and have something like, 'Hey, how are you.'</p><p class=align-left>However, keep in mind that 'Hey' is not a great conversation starter. It would not come out well when you respond to a stranger with the three-letter word, especially on a <a href=#>dating</a> app. And it is even worse if it is your crush, as you will sound non-interested in pursuing them. Sometimes, 'Hey' can be interpreted as rude.</p><a class=c-article-read-also__image-wrapper href=#><img sizes=256px style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/netstorage-tuko.akamaized.net/images/52d23a3557f845c1.jpg></a><a class=c-article-read-also__headline href=# readability=27><p class=c-article-read-also__caption>Read also</p><p class=c-article-read-also__headline-wrapper><span class=c-article-read-also__headline-hover-inner>How to make a girl laugh over text: 100+ funny things to say to a girl</span></p></a><p class=align-left>You can respond with 'Hey' when conversing with someone you know or are familiar with. The most significant determinant of how you respond is your relationship to the sender. In some cases, responding with 'Hey' might come out alright.</p><h3>Challenge her</h3><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/netstorage-tuko.akamaized.net/images/e3a882847d8dab6e.jpeg><p class=align-left>If you wonder how to respond to 'Hey' from a girl on Tinder, you are not alone. The term's vagueness does not give a clear direction on the expected reply. However, you can make the conversation interesting by challenging the girl. It is a tricky route but worth it if it works.</p><p class=align-left>Ladies love challenges. Once you set the ideal mood, a challenge can be somehow intriguing and highly attractive. Women love chasing men that are out of their league. Therefore, maybe acting like one can be a great conversation starter.</p><p class=align-left>What are some of the responses to 'Hey' text that create a challenge?</p><ul><li>I’ll buy first date drinks if you can do better than ‘hey.’</li><li>Ugh, isn’t online dating just THE WORST?</li><li>Describe yourself in 3 emojis</li><li>Two truths and a lie. Go!</li><li>You are hot, but you can do better than that.</li></ul><a class=c-article-read-also__image-wrapper href=#><img sizes=256px style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/netstorage-tuko.akamaized.net/images/7ee533152aa63418.png></a><a class=c-article-read-also__headline href=# readability=27><p class=c-article-read-also__caption>Read also</p><p class=c-article-read-also__headline-wrapper><span class=c-article-read-also__headline-hover-inner>Best pickup lines for Tinder that will get you dates that will pay off</span></p></a><h3>Be direct</h3><p class=align-left>If you find '<a href=# rel="nofollow noopener">Hey' an ice breaker</a>, as most people do, sometimes it is a great idea to be direct and say like it is. You can ask the lady to spice things up. It might sound not polite, but in a true sense comes out as bold, making you even more enjoyable. You can use the following direct replies when a girl texts 'Hey you'.</p><ul><li>Try again!???</li><li>You are an artist, right? I have a hard time believing you can’t create something better than a ‘Hey’ opening line.</li><li>I am not allowed to respond to 'Hi' messages. Try again.</li></ul><p class=align-left>Of course, the reply wouldn't go well with some people. Therefore, it is advisable to use such responses in conversations that you are less concerned about as you do not want to lose your crush's attention.</p><h3>Tell a story</h3><p class=align-left>Another interesting way of how to respond to ‘Hey’ from a girl is to convert the conversation into a fun, <a href=# rel="nofollow noopener">creative story</a>. Such a story would get the other individual involved in the discussion, making it even more enjoyable.</p><a class=c-article-read-also__image-wrapper href=#><img sizes=256px style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/netstorage-tuko.akamaized.net/images/3c6d0788aff601ae.jpg></a><a class=c-article-read-also__headline href=# readability=27><p class=c-article-read-also__caption>Read also</p><p class=c-article-read-also__headline-wrapper><span class=c-article-read-also__headline-hover-inner>100+ best funny jokes to tell a girl you like: impress her</span></p></a><p class=align-left>You can respond by saying something like, "Not good because…" and give a reason. But, remember that whatever reason you come up with, keep it light-hearted and allow the other individual to play along.</p><h3>Do a clickbait</h3><p class=align-left>A clickbait is a great way to make someone intrigued and want to find out more. And you can create the perfect clickbait with three to four words, perfectly designed to make her crave an answer. For example, you can use words like:</p><ul><li>Hey (name), do you know what makes people attracted to you?</li><li>Hey (name), do you know what makes you interesting?</li></ul><p class=align-left>You can also convert the clickbait to a joke by asking something that will require a funny response. Making a joke allows you to test their sense of humour, which can help you decide if you are compatible.</p><p class=align-left>However, ascertain that you tweak your clickbait well to elicit a funny reaction. Some jokes can be offensive, and it is a quick way of making someone lose interest.</p><a class=c-article-read-also__image-wrapper href=#><img sizes=256px style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/netstorage-tuko.akamaized.net/images/7222f56bbfd3a256.jpg></a><a class=c-article-read-also__headline href=# readability=27><p class=c-article-read-also__caption>Read also</p><p class=c-article-read-also__headline-wrapper><span class=c-article-read-also__headline-hover-inner>Amazing badass quotes for men</span></p></a><h3>Give a sarcastic response</h3><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/netstorage-tuko.akamaized.net/images/f39ac4e902a235e4.jpg><p class=align-left>Have you ever thought of using sarcasm in your first conversation with a stranger? Many people looking for more information on how to reply to a 'Hey' text have tried it, and it has worked amazingly well.</p><p class=align-left>You can say, "Wow, that is the most inspiring thing anyone has said to me this day." You can use other words that you consider are perfect for the unique setting. However, always remember to be cautious with sarcasm because it could scare the other person if you are too witty.</p><p class=align-left>Knowing how to respond to ‘Hey’ from a girl is not rocket <a href=#>science</a>. It is upon you to use your creativity and craft the appropriate response. Of course, the three-letter word doesn't have much into it, but you can create fun by responding from a different angle.</p><p class=align-left>Did you know that people in a relationship have different duties? <a href=#>Tuko.co.ke</a> featured an interesting <a href=#>article</a> about girlfriend duties in a relationship, highlighting 30 things they do.</p><a class=c-article-read-also__image-wrapper href=#><img sizes=256px style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/netstorage-tuko.akamaized.net/images/37680e627e1181e2.jpg></a><a class=c-article-read-also__headline href=# readability=27><p class=c-article-read-also__caption>Read also</p><p class=c-article-read-also__headline-wrapper><span class=c-article-read-also__headline-hover-inner>How to reject a girl politely without hurting her feelings</span></p></a><p class=align-left>For instance, women mostly take the role of luxuriating their men in a public display of affection and motivating them.
