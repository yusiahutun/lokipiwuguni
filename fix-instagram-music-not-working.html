Update Instagram</h2><p>One possible reason you can't use the music feature is that your Instagram app is outdated. This means you may not find the <a href=#>"Add music" option while uploading an Instagram story</a>. You also might not see the music icon show up when making Reels or posts. You can update the app on your phone from your respective app store to fix the issue.</p><p>To update the Instagram app, go to Play Store or App Store. Search for Instagram, and then open the app page. If the app requires an update, you will see the <strong>Update</strong> button. If not, it will show the <strong>Open</strong> option. After updating, restart the app.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static1.makeuseofimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2022/11/Search-Instagram-on-the-App-Store.JPG> <img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static1.makeuseofimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2022/11/Open-Instagram.JPG> <span class=txt>Close</span> <strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>You should be able to see the <strong>Add music</strong> option after updating Instagram to the latest version.</p><h2 id=log-out-and-back-into-instagram>2.

Select <strong>Settings</strong> and then <strong>Log Out</strong>.</p><p>Start a new session by logging back into your account. You should now be able to add music and audio.

Apps like Instagram track your location and provide the services available within that particular region.</p><p>You might not have the Instagram music option because of your current location or network settings. Instagram music was initially available in a few countries, like the United States, France, Germany, and Sweden, but was later updated for most countries around the globe.</p><p>If Instagram music or audio is not available in your country, you can also try connecting your phone to a VPN and setting your location where Instagram music is available.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>You should <a href=#>select an appropriate VPN network</a> matching your requirements, as there are many free and paid options available.

Switch to a Professional Instagram Account</h2><p>Personal Instagram accounts may not have certain features that Professional accounts have. This might be why the Instagram music option isn't visible on your profile. By changing the account settings, you might be able to access the Instagram music button.</p><p>Switching to a Professional Instagram account also gives you access to other features, like better post metrics.</p><p>To change your Instagram account from Personal to Professional:</p><li>Tap your profile picture to open your Instagram <strong>Profile</strong>.</li><li>Open the menu from three horizontal lines in the top right corner of the screen.</li><li>Select <strong>Settings</strong>.</li><li>Go to <strong>Account</strong> and scroll down until you see <strong>Switch to Professional Account</strong>.</li><li>Open <strong>Switch to Professional Account</strong> and tap <strong>Continue</strong>.</li><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><li>Select a suitable category from <strong>What Best Describes You?</strong> and tap <strong>Next</strong>.</li><li>Choose <strong>Creator</strong> from the <strong>Are You a Creator?</strong> menu and select <strong>Next</strong>.</li><li>Follow your favorite accounts from <strong>Get Inspired</strong>.</li><li>Let your friends know about your account from <strong>Grow Your Audience</strong>.</li><li>Tap <strong>Introduce Yourself</strong> to add your first post as a creator.</li><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong> <img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static1.makeuseofimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2022/11/Go-to-Instagram-Settings.JPG> <img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static1.makeuseofimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2022/11/Go-to-Account.JPG> <img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static1.makeuseofimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2022/11/Switch-to-professional-account.JPG> <img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static1.makeuseofimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2022/11/Confirm-switching-to-professional-account.JPG> <span class=txt>Close</span><p>You will get access to all the features of a Professional Instagram account.</p><h2 id=switch-back-to-a-personal-account>5. Switch Back to a Personal Account</h2><p>While switching to a professional account can help some users use Instagram music again, it might be the opposite case for others.</p><p>Some users also report that certain types of professional or business accounts might not be allowed to use Instagram music or audio features for possible copyright reasons.</p><p>If you're not an official business, and you want to use Instagram music, you can also change your professional or business account back to a personal account. To do this open Instagram and go to your profile. Then, tap the three bars on the top right and head to <strong>Settings and privacy > Creator tools and controls > Switch account type > Switch to personal account.</strong></p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong> <img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static1.makeuseofimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/instagram-account-settings.jpg> <img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static1.makeuseofimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/instagram-creator-tools.jpg> <img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static1.makeuseofimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/instagram-switch-account-type.jpg> <img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static1.makeuseofimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/switch-account-type-instagram.jpg> <span class=txt>Close</span><p>Switching to a different type of professional account might also work in some cases and regions. But users report switching to a personal account first is the best move.</p><h2 id=reinstall-instagram>6. Reinstall Instagram</h2><p>When nothing seems to be working, try uninstalling the app. You can reinstall Instagram by going to the App Store or Google Play Store. Reinstalling the app deletes the corrupt files that might be preventing Instagram music from functioning properly.</p><p>Reinstalling also updates the app to the latest version (if available), providing you with the most recent Instagram music and audio features.</p><p><strong>Download:</strong> Instagram for <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">iOS</a> | <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer sponsored nofollow" class="norewrite noskim">Android</a></p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=try-using-another-device>7.
