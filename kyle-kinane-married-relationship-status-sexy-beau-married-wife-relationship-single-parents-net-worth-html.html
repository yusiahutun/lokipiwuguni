Also, meanwhile, the two haven't provided any recent updates on their status.&nbsp;</p><span class="ezoic-autoinsert-ad ezoic-mid_content"></span><p>Furthermore, Kyle previously had&nbsp;baffled&nbsp;his fans as he <a href=# rel="nofollow noopener">tweeted</a> about wanting to become a daddy&nbsp;on&nbsp;29 September 2014. He wrote,</p><p>Briefly thought about becoming a father today while laying atop my disposable income during the free time I have in between chasing dreams.</p><span class="ezoic-autoinsert-ad ezoic-under_second_paragraph"></span><p>Now, that might just be a part of his regular jokes; however, he could be expressing his desire of leading a family life in a light-hearted manner, who knows? <span id=ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-609 class=ezoic-adpicker-ad></span></p><p>Amidst the confusion, the only thing that appears to be clear is his marital status as he seemingly isn't married.
