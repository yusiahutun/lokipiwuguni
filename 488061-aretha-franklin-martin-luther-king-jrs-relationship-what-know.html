So, are the stories true? Did Aretha Franklin work with Martin Luther King?</p><h2>Aretha Franklin and Martin Luther King Jr. met when she was young</h2><p class=align-left>Aretha Franklin was destined to meet the legendary civil rights movement leader, Martin Luther King. The <a href=# rel="nofollow noopener">songstress was born</a> in 1942 in Memphis and was raised in Detroit. Growing up, Aretha was surrounded by avid supporters of the civil rights movement, including his father, CL Franklin.</p><p class=align-left>Aretha's father was a Baptist minister and circuit preacher. Therefore, Aretha spent most of her time in church, interacting with the congregation, who were primarily people supporting the civil rights movement.</p><p class=align-left>Aretha's father's influence in the community and the rest of America grew gradually, making him famous. As a result, he started interacting with other influential people like Sam Cooke and Martin Luther King Jr.</p><a class=c-article-read-also__image-wrapper href=#><img sizes=256px style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/netstorage-tuko.akamaized.net/images/da3a99a885372829.png></a><a class=c-article-read-also__headline href=# readability=27><p class=c-article-read-also__caption>Read also</p><p class=c-article-read-also__headline-wrapper><span class=c-article-read-also__headline-hover-inner>JJ Da Boss and Trisha Wayne relationship and Street Outlaws career</span></p></a><p class=align-left>Martin Luther King would visit CL Franklin's home, meeting Aretha Franklin.

And interestingly, Aretha Franklin was one of them, though indirectly.</p><p class=align-left>Historical <a href=# rel="nofollow noopener">records show</a> that the <a href=#>renowned artist</a>, who passed away in 2018, took care of payroll several times. Jesse Jackson revealed this little-known fact about Aretha <a href=# rel="nofollow noopener">during an interview</a>.</p>When Dr King was alive, several times she helped us make payroll. On one occasion, we took an 11-city tour with her as Aretha Franklin and Harry Belafonte ... and they put gas in the vans. She did 11 concerts for free and hosted us at her home, and did a fundraiser for my campaign. Aretha has always been a very socially conscious artist, an inspiration, not just an entertainer.<a class=c-article-read-also__image-wrapper href=#><img sizes=256px style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/netstorage-tuko.akamaized.net/images/5b216546e5d7d1cd.jpg></a><a class=c-article-read-also__headline href=# readability=27><p class=c-article-read-also__caption>Read also</p><p class=c-article-read-also__headline-wrapper><span class=c-article-read-also__headline-hover-inner>Nicolle Wallace and Michael Schmidt relationship: What you should know</span></p></a><p class=align-left>She also did around 11 concerts for free for Martin Luther King Jr. Aretha also hosted many of the activities at her home and even raised funds for the campaign of Jesse Jackson.</p><p class=align-left>Reverend Jim Holley of the Little Rock Baptist Church also praised Aretha for her generous support. He stated:</p>Whenever there was a tragedy with families, any civil rights family, she was always giving. I wish I had the words to express it. She's exceptional in that she sang the blues but never lost her roots in the church and her relationship with God. She used her talent and what God gave her to move the race forward basically….She used a lot of her resources. She was that kind of person, a giving person.<h2>Aretha received an award from MLK before he passed away</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/netstorage-tuko.akamaized.net/images/8a25f830d529ad94.jpg><p class=align-left>Both Martin Luther King Jr. and Aretha Franklin have passed on, but their legacies in their respective fields live on.
