The midseason premiere picked up six months after Olivia Pope (<a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=internalLink data-ordinal=1>Kerry Washington</a>) and President Grant (<a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=internalLink data-ordinal=2>Tony Goldwyn</a>) broke up. Olivia has been taking on new cases at Pope & Associates, like the head of the National Security Agency, while Fitz designated Abby Whelan​ (Darby Stanchfield) to be his new "work wife"—the one he bothers all hours of the day and night. They seem to be navigating single life fairly well, but there is one major thing we noticed in this episode: Why is Olivia wearing so many bright colors?</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_3-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">"The rest of this season is about Olivia being stronger than ever before," the show's costume designer, Lyn Paolo, tells InStyle. "She's fiercely independent and ever so slightly dangerous. She decided that she's going to present herself to the world as a different person. She's reinventing herself. We're trying to express that through how she looks. Because of that, we wanted her in exceptionally bright colors."</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_7-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">Underneath her black double-breasted <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=internalLink data-ordinal=1>Alexander McQueen</a> coat (pictured above), Olivia wears a <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=internalLink data-ordinal=2>Narciso Rodriguez</a> dress in a marigold yellow—a color we've never seen on her before. Guess who else has worn this dress though? "It's <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=internalLink data-ordinal=3>the same one that Mrs. Obama wore</a> at the State of the Union address," Paolo tells us.</p><figure id=mntl-sc-block_9-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block instyle-sc-block-image mntl-sc-block-universal-image mntl-sc-block-image--no-theme no-theme mntl-sc-block-image figure-portrait figure-high-res"><span class=figure-article-caption-owner>© 2016 American Broadcasting Companies, Inc.

"That dress is the very first time we see Olivia in color, so we wanted it to be really bright," Paolo explains. "When she takes off her coat, it's so startling because you've just never seen her in this kind of color before. We did it purposely for shock value."</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_12-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">© 2016 American Broadcasting Companies, Inc.

Of course, it's for good reason. "Now that Olivia's in all the prime colors, like red, blue, orange, and purple, we have to balance the two women out," Paolo says. "You'll see a very different Mellie tonally because they're going to have to do a dance with the colors and tones of their costumes. We're going back to a softer Mellie."</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_30-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">For more of the show's fashion, follow <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=externalLink data-ordinal=1>@LynPaolo</a> and <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=externalLink data-ordinal=2>@ScandalABC</a> on Twitter.
