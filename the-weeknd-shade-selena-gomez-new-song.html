Was it <strong>Justin Biebe</strong>r? Was it<strong> <a href=# id=auto-tag_bella-hadid data-tag=bella-hadid>Bella Hadid</a></strong>? Was it some other unknown factor that led to one of the most devastating celebrity splits in 2017? We might never know the full details, but at least one member of the relationship is spilling some much-needed tea.</p><p>On Thursday night, The Weeknd released a surprise six-song EP titled My Dear Melancholy, and fans have already speculated that the mini-album is about his relationship with Gomez. The song people are paying the most attention to is “Call Out My Name,” a ballad in which The Weeknd suggests that his relationship with Gomez was a “mistake.”</p><p>Related Stories</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/stylecaster.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/02/kendall-jenner-1.png> <img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/stylecaster.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/02/selena-gomez-love-on.png><p>“We found each other/I helped you out of a broken place/You gave me comfort/But falling for you was my mistake,” he sang.</p><p>But those lyrics aren’t what is catching the internet’s attention. Later in the song, The Weeknd referenced Gomez’s now-famous kidney transplant, which she received from her best friend <a href=# rel=noopener><strong>Francia Raisa</strong></a>&nbsp; in summer 2017 after her kidneys failed. In the song, The Weeknd suggests that he was in the running to donate his kidney to Gomez—a decision that he’s now glad that he didn’t make considering the couple’s fallout.</p><p>“I said I didn’t feel nothing baby, but I lied/I almost cut a piece of myself for your life,” he sang.</p><p><span class=embed-youtube></span></p><p>Of course, that wasn’t the only part in “Call Out My Name” that The Weeknd dissed Gomez in. In another part in the song, the “Starboy” singer referenced Gomez’s on-again, off-again boyfriend, Justin Bieber, whom she reunited with shortly after her split with The Weeknd. In the song, The Weeknd accused Gomez of wavering between the two men during their entire relationship.&nbsp;“Guess I was just another pit stop / ‘Til you made up your mind / You just wasted my time,” he sang.</p><p>Gomez wasn’t the only famous ex who received a call-out in My&nbsp;Dear Melancholy. In another song, “Wasted Times,” The Weeknd referenced <strong>Bella Hadid</strong>, whom he broke up with shortly before dating Gomez. “Wasted Times” speaks highly of Hadid, suggesting that Gomez “wasn’t even half” of who she was.&nbsp;“Wasted times I spent with someone else/ She wasn’t even half of you/” he sang.</p><p>The “Can’t Feel My Face” singer, who has been spotted at Hadid’s apartment after his breakup with Gomez, also suggested that he left the door open for the two to rekindle their relationship. “And I know right now that we’re not talkin’/I hope you know this d**ck is still an option/’Cause I’ll beat it up/” he sang.</p><p><span class=embed-youtube></span></p><p>Of course, there are also a few other pointed jabs at Gomez. In “Privilege,” The Weeknd sings about an unknown woman who he considers “privileged” and who he wants to stay away from him. “Enjoy your privileged life/ ‘Cause I’m not gonna hold you through the night/ We said our last goodbyes/ So let’s just try to end it with a smile,” he sang.</p><p>Then, in “Hurt You,” The Weeknd accused an unknown subject of trying to “fill the void with every man” she meets.&nbsp;“And now I know relationships my enemy/ So stay away from me/ I’m warning you/ You try to fill the void with every man you meet/ ‘Cause you’re upset with me/ I’m warning you,” he sang.</p><p>So far, the reaction to The Weeknd’s album has been mixed. Many are praising My Dear Melancholy musically, while others are criticizing him for airing his dirty laundry with Gomez.</p><p>So far, Gomez hasn’t responded to the album. But if we know anything about her and her best friend, <strong>Taylor Swift</strong>, it’s that she has some excellent comeback songs prepared for her own album. And the tea continues.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmirpK65pq%2FArKueql6YvK57xKernqqklravucSnq2ilpai2pHuWa2xrbmlkwamxjLCcnqOemXq0tMCdnGarlaGyr62MoKamnapiu6bDjKymp59f</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./northern-lights-hotels.html><span>←</span><span>The best Northern Lights hotels</span></a>
