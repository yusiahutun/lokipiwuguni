During their 10 days in “The Pods”, the couples decide if they wanted to get engaged—still sight unseen—or end their relationships for a better connection with someone else. After the proposal, the couples meet face-to-face for the first time and go on a honeymoon, where they learn more about each other and meet the other couples. After the trip, the couples, who all live in the same city, return to the real world and move into an apartment together as they meet each other’s families and friends and prepare for their weddings. At the altar on their wedding days, the couples must decide whether to marry or breakup as they answer the age-old question of if love can be truly blind.</p><p>Related Stories</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/stylecaster.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/03/Outlander.jpg> <img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/stylecaster.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/11/Outlander.jpg><p>Since <a href=# rel=noopener>Love Is Blind</a> premiered on Netlix in 2020, the show has become one of service’s highest-rated series, with more than 30 million views in its first two months. “Across the world, everybody feels the same way: Everyone wants to be loved for who they are on the inside. It doesn’t matter where you live, what you look like, how old you are, what your background is, which class you know, or social structure you feel like you’re a part of, everyone wants to be loved for who they are,” creator Chris Coelen told Variety in 2020. “In today’s society we’ve got all these ways to find love through dating apps and technology. Those things sort of counterintuitively have made people feel disposable. They’ve made people feel like it’s all surface level. It does the opposite thing it was supposed to do. So we thought, what if we took everybody’s devices away, how could we get them to focus on connecting with other people?”</p><p>Coelen also told <a href=# rel=noopener>Variety</a> about how&nbsp;the connections on <a href=# rel=noopener>Love Is Blind</a> were based on choice, which is why the relationships were that much stronger. “It was incredibly scary because nobody had to do anything, versus a show like we do Married at First Sight, you sign up and you know, you’re getting married to a stranger. Here, nobody had to do anything. It was if you find someone, if you choose. Which is so scary. They don’t have to go through with the wedding ceremony,” he said. “But assuming they found someone, could that love overcome any judgment in the real world? That’s an incredibly fascinating question. And that’s what we set out to try to examine.”</p><p>But back to Jackie and Josh. So…are <a href=# rel=noopener>Jackie and Josh still together from Love Is Blind season 4</a>? Read on for what we know about if Jackie and Josh are still together from Love Is Blind season 4 and where they are now.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/stylecaster.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/03/Jackie-Josh-Love-Is-Blind-Season-4.png><p>Are Jackie and Josh still together from Love Is Blind season 4? The answer is yes. Jackelina Bonds and Josh Demas met in The Pods on Love Is Blind season 4, but didn’t get engaged after Jackie broke up with Josh to get engaged to Marshall. Jackie and Marshall broke up in episode 10 after Jackie skipped her wedding dress fitting and and went on a date with Josh, where they kissed.</p><p>Jackie and Josh confirmed they were still together during the Love Is Blind Season 4 “After the Altar” special, which saw them move in together. TikTok user @<a rel="noopener nofollow" href=#>snowflake1971</a> also confirmed Jackie and Josh were still together with a video of them at a Seattle Mariners game in March 2023. “look who I seen last night,” the user captioned the video, which showed Jackie and Josh walking to their seats. In April 2023, an anonymous Instagram account believed to be Jackie’s friend also allegedly leaked a group text between Jackie and her friends at the time she broke up with Marshall to be with Josh. “He gives me vibes. YALL and I kinda hinted at that in my interview & all hell broke lose [sic]. So I had to like switch it up,” Jackie allegedly wrote in the group text of Marshall. “But he fosho gives me vibes cause he use to twrk on the bed & I told him I was coo off that & he was like yeah. So now this time I told him to be more aggressive with me. He’s hard fosho but sometimes he can be SWEET.” One friend allegedly texted back, “TWERK ON THE BED? LMFAOOOOO. JACKIE. Good for you, also, for communicating how bad of a turn off that shit is wth.”</p><p>Jackie allegedly texted back, “Yes he will twerk on the bed & I was like yeah no that’s not gone fly big homie lol & then he will talk like ‘yasss’ & im like ?????? THATS THE DAMN TRUTH. ION WANNA HEAR YALL AT MY WEDDING YELLIN BOUT HOW HE GOT SUGAR IN HIS TANK EITHER PLASSS. we gotta make it stretch for <a href=# id=auto-tag_tv data-tag=tv>tv</a> bye.” A second friend allegedly texted back, “LMAOOO nooo gotta make it to the altar.” Jackie allegedly responded, “I can hear [REDACTED] yellin ‘HES A TEAPOT'” The account also shared an alleged screenshot of a DM from Jackie in which she sent a video of her and Josh with the message: “My baby.”After the the texts went viral, Marshall responded to them in a tweet which read, “The only ‘sugar’ I got goes on those f*cking pancakes.”</p><p>Jackie also confirmed she and Josh were still together in an interview with <a href=# rel="noopener nofollow">Today</a> in April 2023, in which she recalled the first time they met in person. “The first time I ever saw Josh, it was very surreal because I’ve never seen him before and walking into Chelsea’s party, I only heard his voice,” she said. “I instantly had a That’s So Raven moment where I was kind of like a flashback. He’s good looking. He’s smelling good, but I’m not hearing any of the words like he’s telling me, because I’m just not present at that time.” As for their relationship now, Jackie told Today, “Going forward and moving forward with Josh. It was actually very surreal. It was actually very intimate, very soul-binding, I would say, because it’s almost kind of like, we are very strong.”</p><p>Jackie also confirmed that she and Josh were still together in an interview with<a href=# rel="noopener nofollow"> Entertainment Tonight</a> after the Love Is Blind season 4 reunion. “Me and Josh are still going strong,” she said at the time. “We are getting a place together. He hangs out with my family all the time.” She also confirmed the relationship in an <a href=# rel="noopener nofollow">Instagram</a> post at the time. “A year of standing side by side with my other half. Our journey to find each other was not easy but it was worth it. Thank you for loving me, standing by me and protecting me. I love you forever and through every realm &nbsp;@jdemas Thank you @loveisblindnetflix for this amazing experience,” she captioned a photo of her and Josh.</p><p>After the Love Is Blind season 4 reunion, Jackie also apologized for her behavior toward Marshall during their season. “I would like to start this off by saying I sincerely apologize and take accountability for my actions and words in my relationship between Marshall and I,” she wrote in an Instagram post. “I also want to take the time to express my gratitude and appreciation for Marshall clearing up that I did in fact end the relationship before meeting Josh at the coffee shop. I understand that it was a quick transition from one relationship to another but this relationship did not start as most do in the real world.”</p><p>She continued, “To some it may seem as if it was a quick transition, however there is only a small percent that can be shown on tv and my connection with Josh was much deeper than it seems from a viewers perspective. I also would like to thank Marshall for taking accountability the derogatory comment that was made off camera.”</p><p>Jackie also admitted to <a href=# rel=noopener>leaked text messages</a> between her and her friends, in which she suggested that Marshall wasn’t honest to her about his sexuality. “I would also like to apologize and take accountability for my disparaging remarks as well in those leaked messages,” she wrote. “It was tasteless and disrespectful to speak about anyone that way. It was never a battle between Marshall and I. I just wanted to clear the timeline of the events that took place as it looked as if I was a cheater and starting one relationship before leaving the other. “</p><p>She continued, “I am thankful that Vanessa Lachey allowed me to speak my peace and take accountability for my actions. All I can do is learn and grow from this experience. Like Marshall said at the reunion we both deserve happiness, peace, and to be able move on from what transpired last year. Marshall and I have personally apologized to each and also took accountability for our actions and have moved on. I would also like to apologize and take accountability to the public as it was done on the show for everyone to see. Actions speak louder than words.”</p><p>In an <a rel="noopener nofollow" href=#>Instagram</a> post after her last episode of Love Is Blind season 4, Jackie also accused the show’s editing of making it seem like she went on a date with Josh before breaking up with Marshall. “I have seen the latest episodes that have premiered on Love Is Blind and I must speak the truth. Marshall and I werre broken up before I saw Josh at the coffee shop,” she wrote. “I am wearing different clothes, my hair is styled different and at the end of the video I say “I DON’T KNOW IF I AM GOING TO BE WITH JOSH.” I am not sure what the reason is for playing the coffee shop date before the break up but to restate, Marshall and I were broken up before Josh and I had our coffee shop date. As for the ring, Marshall did not pay for the ring. Love Is Blind paid for all the rings.”</p><p>Before his relationship with Jackie, Josh was engaged Monica Rodriguez, another contestant on Love Is Blind Season 4. Monica hinted in an Instagram post in April 2023 that she and Josh got engaged before he got back together with Jackie on Love Is Blind Season 4. “LIB ENGAGEMENT ALERT*** Since EVERYONE was given the opportunity to share their stores, I can finally tell mine,” Monica captioned a photo of her engagement ring. “Many of you have messaged me about my journey asking if I found love in the pods. As many of you might know, not all stories are shown on camera. When I joined Love is Blind I was truly ready to find the love of my life. I had spent intentional time working on myself and ensuring I was who I wanted to be, for myself and my future partner. I wanted to show up emotionally/mentally healthy and available.”</p><p>She continued, “This experiment encouraged me to be vulnerable and share parts of myself that are not easily accessible. As my relationships began to develop, I thought I had found somebody who finally saw me and accepted me for me. I accepted his proposal and we were onto the reveal.”</p><p>In her post, Monica explained that she and Josh broke up after she had doubts he was The One following their reveal. “During the reveal, reality set in and my heart and mind were torn. I wasn’t sure if I had made the right decision or picked the right person,” she wrote. “The only thing I did know was that you shouldn’t feel torn on your engagement day. It should be a decision in your life that is made with great confidence and no second thoughts.”</p><p>She continued, “This is when I realized that this wasn’t gods plan for me. I wasn’t at peace with my decision and ended our engagement shortly after filming. Since then, I have continued to work on myself and am grateful to Love is Blind for the opportunity to participate in an experiment where people really do find their person. I wouldn’t change anything about my experience. I’m proud of myself for giving love another chance. I continue to keep an open heart for the person god has single-handedly designed for me. Thank you for reaching out and for all the love and support you’ve sent my way. May everyone find their someone one day.”</p><p>Monica also confirmed that she kept Josh’s engagement ring. “And yes, I kept the ring 💍 @loveisblindnetflix #loveisblindfinale,” she wrote. Though Monica didn’t name Josh in her post, fans discovered that her fiance was Josh based on articles about other engaged men who weren’t shown in Love Is Blind Season 4. Along with Monica and Josh, two other engagements also weren’t shown in Love Is Blind Season 4, according to Netflix’s <a rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow" href=#>Tudum</a> site: Jimmy Fode and Wendi Kong; and Ava Van Jenson and JP Shultz.</p><p>Monica appeared at cast party on Love Is Blind Season 4’s “After the Altar” special, where she got into an argument with Josh and Jackie, who was her best friend while filming in The Pods, over her Instagram post. Josh and Jackie felt like Monica trying to cause drama with her post, while Monica claimed that she just wanted to tell her side of her story that wasn’t shown on TV.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/stylecaster.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/03/Jackie-Love-Is-Blind-Season-4.jpg><p>Who is Jackie from Love Is Blind season 4?

In a <a href=# rel="noopener nofollow">video</a> announcing the full Love Is Blind season 4 cast in March 2023, Josh described his one rule as no liars allowed. Josh also listed his job as a “Comedian” on his Instagram.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/stylecaster.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/03/Love-Is-Blind-Season-4-1.jpg><p>Love Is Blind season 4 was filmed in Seattle, Washington. Love Is Blind season 1 was filmed in Atlanta, Georgia; season 2 was filmed in Chicago, Illinois; and season 3 was filmed in Dallas, Texas. In an interview with <a href=# rel="noopener nofollow">Entertainment Tonight</a> in 2020, Love Is Blind creator Chris Coelen explained that each season casts contestants from the same city so long distance isn’t a factor in their relationships. “It was a really interesting and diverse cast in terms of the fact that they were all from many different places originally,” he said. “But they were all living around the Atlanta area [at the time of casting]. The reason that we did that was because we wanted to give these people a real shot at making their relationships work for the long term.”</p><p>He continued, “Whether you think [love] is going to happen or not, we wanted people that would be ready to be married. If you’re really in it—genuinely in it, which was the No. 1 casting criteria—it felt to us that it was too much of a bridge for someone living in Miami and someone living in Seattle to build. We thought let’s at least start with them in the same geographical area.”</p><p>Coelen also explained to <a href=# rel=noopener>Variety</a> in 2020 about why he wanted each Love Is Blind season to cast contestants from the same city. “We wanted people to all be living, currently in the same place. It’s too difficult if you’re from Tampa and they’re from Portland, that just throws another wrench in. We wanted to give them a real shot at making their love and their marriage working,” he said. Coelen also told Variety at the time about the locations he was looking at for future Love Is Blind seasons. “Look, the idea is that ultimately we’re going to do this in other countries—it’s very global. There’s lots of places that that we could take it. Chicago is a great place to look at, so is New York, Boston, Houston. There’s so many different places that we could go. And like I said, outside of the country as well,” he said.</p><p>Coelen also told <a href=# rel="noopener nofollow">Oprah</a> magazine in 2020 that The Pods lasted around 10 days, which started with a series of speed dates between contestants that lasted between eight to 12 minutes. We did a ranking system, from who you though was most compatible to least compatible after the first date. Every day, the list got shorter and shorter,” Love Is Blind season 1 contestant Mark Cuevas told Oprah magazine at the time. Coelen also told Oprah magazine made the cast smaller a few days into the The Pods stage to focus on the contestants forming “real connections.” “We ended up focusing on people who were really forming real connections,” he said.</p><p>Though the dates started short, Coelen told Variety that the producers allowed contestants to have longer dates once they saw how strong their connections were. “In the beginning nobody knew who anybody was. So we structured it so that they would have an opportunity to talk to everyone. They were never given any instruction on what to say or what not to say or what they could ask about or what they couldn’t ask about. And you see on the show, some people decided to [ask] ‘How tall are you, what do you look like?'” he said. “Other people were like, ‘Why would I ever do that? That’s not the point of this.’ We really wanted it to be their own story, their own journey. We would set it up so they had the opportunity to talk to everybody. Then from that point [it was monitored]. Let’s say somebody really wanted to talk to you and you’re like, ‘Yeah, I have no interest in that person.'”</p><p>He continued, “You’re not going to talk to them. It doesn’t matter. We’re not going to arrange people to speak to one another where somebody’s like, ‘yeah, I don’t want to talk to that person.’ We just wouldn’t do that. Multiple points throughout the day we had to break and they had to eat, go to the bathroom, go do interviews, but generally we wanted to give them as much time in the pods as possible with the people that they genuinely wanted to talk to. These dates are obviously cut down but they were hours and hours and hours long.”</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/stylecaster.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/03/Nick-Lachey-Vanessa-Lachey-Love-Is-Blind.jpg><p>The Love Is Blind season 4 hosts are Nick Lachey and Vanessa Lachey, who have hosted the series since it premiered in February 2020. The couple also hosted season 1 of Netflix’s The Ultimatum. Nick was the lead singer of the boy band 98 Degrees from 1996 to 2012. The group reunited in 2012 and are still together. Nick has also released four solo alums: SoulO, What’s Left of Me, A Father’s Lullaby and Soundtrack of My Life. He was married to Jessica Simpson from 2002 to 2006, and the two also starred in their own reality show, Newlyweds: Nick and Jessica on MTV, from 2003 to 2005. Nick is also the winner of season 5 of The Masked Singer&nbsp;during which he performed as the character “Piglet.” Vanessa was the 1998 Miss Teen USA and was a correspondent for Entertainment Tonight and Total Request Live on MTV. She’s the current lead in CBS’ NCIS spinoff, NCIS: Hawai’i, which premiered in 2021.</p><p>In an interview with <a href=# rel="noopener nofollow">Distractify</a> in March 2022, Nick explained that he and Vanessa wanted to host Love Is Blind because of how their own relationship was long distance when they first started dating. “When Netflix approached us with Love is Blind all those years ago, we jumped at the opportunity because the show really spoke to us personally,” Nick said. “When we first started dating, Vanessa was in New York and I was in Los Angeles. We didn’t get to see each other a lot so we had a lot of long phone conversations, learning everything we possibly could about each other.” He continued, “[Those conversations were] really important for building our relationship and knowing we wanted the same things before there were external pressures on the relationship.” Nick also told Distractify that he and Vanessa want contestants to “fall in love for the right reasons and then introduce everything else.”</p><p>Nick also told <a href=# rel="noopener nofollow">People</a> in 2022 about how he thinks Love Is Blind would’ve worked for him and Vanessa if they had met in The Pods.&nbsp;“We’ve thought about that, often. And I really, I’m not just saying this for the benefit of this show, I think we would’ve,” he said. “We have the same birthday, we have the same passions, we have the same interests, we have the same drive. Things that motivated us.” Vanessa asked “You would’ve found me through a wall?” to which Nick responded, “I would find you anywhere.” He continued, “I really do think we would’ve found each other. I think we would’ve gravitated to each other. That’s what we did in life. Obviously, we knew each other.” Vanessa added, “We did. We had to find our journey to get to each other.”</p><p><span class=s1>Nick also claimed to <a href=# rel=nofollow><span class=s2><i>Us </i></span><span class=s3><i>Weekly</i></span></a></span><span class=s4>&nbsp;in 2022 that he would’ve joined <i>Love Is Blind</i> if he was single. “I would.
