In an exclusive interview with Closer Weekly, the new father-of-two opened up about some health woes he’s been experiencing. We have to admit, we would never be able to tell anything was wrong just by looking at him.</p><p>“I thought I was going to die,” he explained of his “chronic pain and headaches.” George also added, “I’ve gone from where<br>I can’t function, where, ‘I just can’t live like this,’ to ‘I’ve got a bad headache.’” Geez — that sounds awful! The incident that caused this happened back in 2005, when he sustained a spinal injury filming the docudrama Syriana alongside <a href=#>Matt Damon</a> and <a href=#>Amanda Peet</a>.</p><p>In 2011, the <a href=#>ER</a> star admitted he contemplated suicide over the ordeal. “I was lying in a hospital bed with an IV in my arm, unable to move, having these headaches where it feels like you’re having a stroke, and for a short three-week period, I started to think, ‘I may have to do something drastic about this,'” he told <a href=#>Rolling Stone</a> at the time.</p><p>“You start to think in terms of, you don’t want to leave a mess, so go in the garage, go in the car, start the engine. It seems like the nicest way to do it, but I never thought I’d get there. See, I was in a place where I was trying to figure out how to survive.”</p><p>One thing is for certain, though — George has his sense of humor back today. He recently opened up about his and <a href=#>Amal Clooney</a>‘s twins, Ella and Alexander — who were born on June 6, 2017, and joked that he hopes they don’t wind up <a href=#>talking in a British accent</a>. He quipped, “I got a little Brit in me. I spent the last six months there. I better shake them quick before they sound like you!”</p><p>For more on this, pick up the latest issue of Closer Weekly — and for more exclusive content sign up for our <a href=#>newsletter</a>!</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7pLjOrJyrr5WauK3FjZympmegpMC1v46gnKiql5p6pLjOqKWesV2dsqK406FknKeemba1tc6nZJygoqS7qq%2BMqZiipl1mgXKDk3Fm</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./luxury-gifts-for-women.html><span>←</span><span>80 Best Luxury Gifts for Women 2024</span></a>
