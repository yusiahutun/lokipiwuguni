I am forever grateful to my American Idol family and I will always look back at the experience with the utmost gratitude and fondness. Please go vote for my friends now as they continue on in the competition.”</p><p>Rex is the son of actor <strong>Malcolm McDowell</strong> and <strong>Kelley Kuhr</strong>, who are also the parents of sons Finnian, 16, and Seamus, 14. The Caligula star, 79, is also the father of adult children <strong>Lily McDowell</strong> and film director <a href=#><strong>Charlie McDowell</strong></a>, whom he shares with ex-wife <a href=#><strong>Mary Steenburgen</strong></a>. Charlie, for his part, is married to actress <a href=#><strong>Lily Collins</strong></a>, <a href=#>whom he wed</a> in September 2021.</p><p>The “Wildfire” crooner is not the only <a href=#>child of a celebrity</a> who competed — and subsequently quit — season 21 of American Idol. <a href=#><strong>Kaya Stewart</strong></a>, who is the daughter of Eurythmics singer <strong>Dave Stewart</strong>, abruptly left the series earlier this month. Kaya, 23, explained she made the decision to leave the competition after getting sick ahead of her duet with fellow competitor <strong>Fire Wilmore</strong>.</p><p>“I always want to give my best, and I’m not giving my best here,” she said at the time. “And I don’t think it’s a fair representation of myself to do that — or for Fire either. I don’t think it’s fair on her to not give one hundred percent when she’s giving 100 percent.”</p><h3>Thank You!</h3><p>You have successfully subscribed.</p><p>In addition to Rex and Kaya, <a href=#><strong>Sarah Beth Liebe</strong></a> also decided to bow out of the competition to take care of her three children.</p><p>Keep scrolling to learn more about Beckett:</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tr%2FMmp6aspmjsm%2BvzqZmnqakmr%2B1rcinpJ6mpGS9qq%2FTrqmeq1%2BWuqa%2ByJyYp2WZmbytecClrKZlkpqwrLHTrWSrnahiuqax02akmqSTpLmuecycm6ivlaG5tHnSqKVo</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./video-eva-marcille-stuns-bejeweled-look-2023-bet-awards-html.html><span>←</span><span>Video: Eva Marcille stuns in bejeweled look at the 2023 BET Awards</span></a>
