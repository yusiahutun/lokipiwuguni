Clothing and accessories, Halsey’s own.</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=1 class="body-dropcap css-803sjt emevuu60">Even before Lauren Halsey’s artwork was installed this past spring on the rooftop of New York’s Metropolitan Museum of Art, she knew it would one day wind up back in Los Angeles. The piece, a sculptural work titled the eastside of south central los angeles hieroglyph prototype architecture (I), is a 22-foot-high, open-air structure modeled on aspects of the Egyptian Temple of Dendur on view in the museum’s galleries and commissioned as part of its ongoing Roof Garden series. Halsey’s work, though, is covered in carved hieroglyphs featuring images, phrases, and portraits of artists and friends drawn from her own life growing up in South Central Los Angeles, where her family has lived since the 1920s. Sphinx-like statues of her mother, her brother, a cousin, and her longtime partner, Monique McWilliams, guard the entrances. Halsey, who still lives and works in South Central, has a spot in her neighborhood picked out for the piece to be reinstalled permanently and is now working through the logistics involved in making it happen. “It’s going to exist on a block in the middle of the rhythm of the street, which is amazing,” she tells me. “It will return to the context that it emanates from.”</p><span aria-hidden=true class="css-0 eagam8p0"></span>“You do things with people and you make things and you accomplish things together.”<p>Lauren Halsey</p><span aria-hidden=true class="css-0 eagam8p1"></span><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=3 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">Halsey’s works, which frequently combine pharaonic symbols and architecture with the Afrofuturism of Sun Ra and Pedro Bell’s artwork for George Clinton’s Funkadelic albums, can sometimes seem like monuments—a way to archive certain moments or chronologies that were important or formative for her. But they are really more like visions. Before moving into art, she studied architecture, and the process of rendering, prototyping, and modeling remains central to her practice. Her collages, mixed-media works, installations, and even shows often have the feeling of colorful, exuberant—or “funkified,” in her terminology—studies for something larger and more all-encompassing.</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=4 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">It’s a creative impulse that began to come into focus for Halsey while riding her bike or the bus and witnessing waves of boom, bust, and redevelopment wash over South Central. “I would see the exterior of the neighborhood very slowly,” she says. “There were still so many vacant lots and things weren’t being developed. Stadiums weren’t there, the condos. So I was able to, on these very long rides, dream up the spaces that I hoped to exist there one day. I would go home and make these very dense collages describing my rearrangement of the block and my new forms and these new ideas.”<br></p><img alt="artist lauren halsey" title="artist lauren halsey" width=1700 height=2125 decoding=async data-nimg=1 sizes=100vw src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/hips.hearstapps.com/hmg-prod/images/hbz120123welllaart-009-wm-656ca9c74f4ee.png style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center><span class="css-1urwh1q e1geg53v2">Andy Jackson</span><p>Clothing and accessories, Halsey’s own.</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=6 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">Halsey says she first became conscious of the fact that there were external forces operating on her neighborhood as a kid during the 1992 uprising following the Rodney King verdict. “I very viscerally remember my father holding my brother, and my mother and I going next door to my grandmother’s house, what that sounded like, looked like, and smelled like,” she says. “But I also remember the next morning driving up and down Manchester to school and back home, while also simultaneously thinking about ice cream trucks and these moments of play and pause,” she recalls. “For me that enunciated the beauty in my neighborhood louder than ever. I remember being like, ‘Oh, there are still pops of color. There’s still a community coming together.’”</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=7 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">Early on, Halsey would enlist friends and neighbors to help realize her works, even sometimes constructing them in people’s backyards. “Growing up in a Black Baptist church and holidays come around, it’s all a collective,” she says. “You’re constantly doing things with people, whether that means you’re in practice for a play, you’re reciting lines, someone’s helping me build a set,” she explains. “You do things with people and you make things and you accomplish things together.”<br></p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=8 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">That was the impetus for Summaeverythang, the community center Halsey created in 2020, early on in the pandemic, to help provide access to food for people in the area. She is now in the process of creating a new permanent home for Summaeverythang and expanding the center into a full-on resource and gathering place near her studio.<br></p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=9 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">“It’s its own storefront, on a street that’s a couple doors down from a middle school and high school, where I intend to program directly with the students and offer creative support, intellectual support, a space to chill, to experiment musically—whatever that means for kids, to shape-shift with whatever their needs are,” Halsey says. “It’s not enough to just represent,” she explains. “Because I’m dealing with stories, I’m dealing with people, I have to equally commit in the best way I can to the development, transcendence, and growth of people here in real time in ways that the art or a sculpture cannot do.”</p><img alt="artist judy baca" title="artist judy baca" width=1700 height=2125 decoding=async data-nimg=1 sizes=100vw src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/hips.hearstapps.com/hmg-prod/images/hbz120123welllaart-007-wm-656cf042983a3.png style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center><span class="css-1urwh1q e1geg53v2">Andy Jackson</span><p>Artist Judy Baca in her Venice studio with&nbsp;Danza de la Tierra (2008).

It’s a great American folk tradition that extends to the city’s art world. L.A.—and not New York—is where Andy Warhol first showed his Campbell’s Soup Cans, at Irving Blum’s legendary Ferus Gallery. Walt Disney, of all people, helped create L.A.’s most vaunted art school, the California Institute of the Arts, or CalArts. Überdealer Larry Gagosian got his start selling posters in Westwood Village.</p><span aria-hidden=true class="css-0 eagam8p0"></span>“What I saw was people trying to get recognition for their presence in the world.”<p>Judy Baca</p><span aria-hidden=true class="css-0 eagam8p1"></span><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=13 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">These, though, are particularly heady times for art in L.A. Institutions like LACMA (Los Angeles County Museum of Art), the Museum of Contemporary Art (MOCA), the Hammer Museum, and, more recently, the Broad are all pursuing ambitious expansions and programs. In 2022, comedian Cheech Marin, in partnership with the Riverside Art Museum, helped launch the Cheech, which is dedicated to Chicano art, while filmmaker George Lucas’s sprawling and audacious Lucas Museum of Narrative Art is set to open in Exposition Park in 2025. Within the past three years, a clutch of East Coast galleries, including Jeffrey Deitch, James Fuentes, Marian Goodman, Sean Kelly, Hauser & Wirth, Pace, and David Zwirner, have all opened new spaces in L.A., alongside local stalwarts such as Blum & Poe, David Kordansky Gallery, Morán Morán, Night Gallery, Regen Projects, Roberts Projects, and Various Small Fires (VSF). Frieze Los Angeles has also become a blockbuster art fair.<br></p><img alt="artist catherine opie" title="artist catherine opie" width=1700 height=2125 decoding=async data-nimg=1 sizes=100vw src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/hips.hearstapps.com/hmg-prod/images/hbz120123welllaart-013-wm-656e0fa6e50b0.png style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center><span class="css-1urwh1q e1geg53v2">Andy Jackson</span><p>Artist Catherine Opie in her studio.

MOCA is currently hosting “Mapping an Art World: Los Angeles in the 1970s-80s,” which explores the period when heavy hitters like John Baldessari, Mike Kelley, and Ed Ruscha were all getting their footing. Destination Crenshaw, a “reparative urban development” in South Central, will be inaugurated in February with a sculpture garden, Sankofa Park, featuring works by Charles Dickson, Maren Hassinger, Artis Lane, and Kehinde Wiley, that is set to become the largest public-arts initiative dedicated to the work of Black artists in the country. And a new edition of PST Art, an ongoing project shepherded by Getty to explore the contributions of artists in Southern California across multiple institutions, will kick off in 2024 with a focus on the intersections of art and science.<br></p><span aria-hidden=true class="css-0 eagam8p0"></span>“L.A. has these really interesting roots in relationship to the idea of utopia.”<p>Catherine Opie</p><span aria-hidden=true class="css-0 eagam8p1"></span><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=18 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">Various Small Fires founder Esther Kim Varet also sees it as part of a wider shift in the way curators and institutions are now thinking about artistic production, with less focus on the classical European traditions that have long dominated and a growing investment in exploring the kinds of Asian and Latin influences that are very present in Southern California. Varet first established Various Small Fires as a project space in 2012, and the gallery now has outposts in Seoul, South Korea, and her hometown of Dallas. Its roster includes contemporary talent like Sara Anstis and 2023 MacArthur Fellow Dyani White Hawk, as well as the estates of influential Southern California artists Billy Al Bengston and Newton and Helen Mayer Harrison, the late husband-and-wife duo known as the Harrisons. “I’m not European American; I’m very much Asian American,” says Varet, whose parents immigrated to the U.S. from South Korea. “But I spent my early adult career adopting and not only internalizing but also regurgitating the power dynamics of a history that didn’t belong to me.”</p><img alt="curator christine y kim" title="curator christine y kim" width=1600 height=2000 decoding=async data-nimg=1 sizes=100vw src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/hips.hearstapps.com/hmg-prod/images/hbz120123welllaart-002-wm-656a13c87fce3.png style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center><span class="css-1urwh1q e1geg53v2">Andy Jackson</span><p>Christine Y.

Additional accessories, Kim’s own.</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=20 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">Varet also points to renewed interest artists such as the Harrisons, who were leading pioneers of the ecoart movement in the 1970s, focusing on subjects like climate change decades before it was part of the global conversation: “I look out for artists who feel that way now, who are looking at things and predicting things 50 years into the future.”<br></p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=21 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">According to Sotheby’s chairman and president of the Americas Mari-Claudia Jiménez, the collector base in L.A. is also changing. “There are some major historic collections that have come from the Los Angeles area,” she says. “But what we’re seeing now is a new generation of collectors in Los Angeles who are really changing the landscape of what the L.A. art scene is. We are seeing collectors of color who are really interested in buying artworks that speak to them and to their communities. We’re seeing a huge growth in women collectors and collectors who are focused on new paradigms. I think that L.A. has really been at the sort of cutting edge of that.”</p><span aria-hidden=true class="css-0 eagam8p0"></span>“There are limited resources for small nonprofits. But we all got together.”<p>Christine Y. Kim</p><span aria-hidden=true class="css-0 eagam8p1"></span><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=23 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">The impact of the art coming out of L.A. has also extended beyond the city limits. Halsey recently joined mega-gallery Gagosian (she will continue to be jointly represented by her longtime L.A. gallerist, David Kordansky) and is preparing for upcoming shows in 2024 at both Gagosian’s Paris outpost and London’s Serpentine Galleries. Halsey’s former CalArts professor, the conceptual artist Charles Gaines, is the subject of a new retrospective at the Institute of Contemporary Art Miami. And MOCA’s 2022 Henry Taylor survey “Henry Taylor: B-Side,” moved in October to the Whitney Museum of American Art in New York during what has been a banner year for Taylor, whose work appeared both in Pharrell's first menswear collection for Louis Vuitton and onstage as part of a Kendrick Lamar performance.</p><img alt="artist martine syms" title="artist martine syms" width=1500 height=1875 decoding=async data-nimg=1 sizes=100vw src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/hips.hearstapps.com/hmg-prod/images/hbz120123welllaart-014-wm-656cf10c48a79.png style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center><span class="css-1urwh1q e1geg53v2">Andy Jackson</span><p>Artist Martine Syms.

In 1964, Noah Purifoy, Judson Powell, and Sue Welsh founded the Watts Towers Arts Center in the Watts section of South Central. The center was established in part as a way to preserve and maintain Watts Towers, a conglomeration of 17 sculptural structures created by Italian-born construction worker Simon Rodia between 1921 and 1954 out of discarded steel rebar, mosaic tiles, wire mesh, mortar, and other scavenged materials. Rodia said little about why he created the sculptures, but he called the work Nuestro Pueblo (“Our Town”), a phrase that took on added meaning in an area of L.A. where decades of migration, segregation, and discriminatory real estate covenants and practices all contributed to an atmosphere of racial tension. In the aftermath of the August 1965 Watts Rebellion, which led to fires that destroyed huge swaths of the neighborhood, Purifoy, Powell, and others collected the charred debris, including the remnants of neon signs from local businesses. With the help of local artists and artisans, they feverishly fashioned the artifacts into 66 separate assemblage works, an exhibition called “66 Signs of Neon.”<br></p><span aria-hidden=true class="css-0 eagam8p0"></span>“It was a continuation of that community and being part of the community.”<p>Martine Syms</p><span aria-hidden=true class="css-0 eagam8p1"></span><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=28 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">Watts Towers and the Watts Towers Arts Center would serve as a north star for multiple generations of artists in L.A. The conceptual artist David Hammons moved from Springfield, Illinois, to L.A. in the 1960s and sought out Purifoy as a mentor. Betye Saar, who spent her early years and summers at her grandmother’s house in Watts, watched Rodia’s structures rise and has said that they inspired her own trajectory as an assemblage artist. The sculptor John Outterbridge, who also worked in assemblage, would later succeed Purifoy as director of the Watts Towers Arts Center. A preteen Nipsey Hussle learned to make beats at Watts Towers. An image of Watts Towers is etched into Halsey’s Met installation.</p><img alt="artist ej hill" title="artist ej hill" width=1700 height=2125 decoding=async data-nimg=1 sizes=100vw src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/hips.hearstapps.com/hmg-prod/images/hbz120123welllaart-015-wm-656a128fb45ae.png style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center><span class="css-1urwh1q e1geg53v2">Andy Jackson</span><p>Artist EJ Hill in South Central.

Hat and earring, Hill’s own.</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=30 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">Purifoy later described this social potential he saw in art, which in some ways transcended the work itself. “There must be more inside of art than the creative act,” he wrote. “There must also be a me who is affected permanently.”<br></p><span aria-hidden=true class="css-0 eagam8p0"></span>“It was this space where I could ask all these questions about my position in the world.”<p>EJ Hill</p><span aria-hidden=true class="css-0 eagam8p1"></span><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=32 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">In the mid-1970s, another artist from Watts, Judy Baca, started a citywide mural program, working with members of individual communities to create public-art pieces that reflect their respective cultures and histories, inspired by Mexican muralists such as Diego Rivera and José Clemente Orozco. In 1975, Baca, now the subject of an expansive exhibition at LACMA, began work on the largest and most ambitious project of her career: The Great Wall of Los Angeles, a mural that extends more than half a mile along the walls of the Tujunga Wash and offers a chronology of the people and events that have shaped Southern California, from its prehistoric beginnings through the 1950s. Baca recalls first becoming interested in muralism after graduating from art school in 1969, a time when opposition to the Vietnam War, particularly in Latin communities in L.A., was growing, and being struck by the phrase yo soy (“I am”) tagged on walls and doorways. “I started to see all the writing in the street,” she says. “But what I saw was people trying to get recognition for their presence in the world.”</p><img alt="various small fires founder esther kim varet" title="various small fires founder esther kim varet" width=1500 height=1875 decoding=async data-nimg=1 sizes=100vw src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/hips.hearstapps.com/hmg-prod/images/hbz120123welllaart-023-wm-656a25ec502b8.png style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center><span class="css-1urwh1q e1geg53v2">Andy Jackson</span><p>Esther Kim Varet, with Sara Antsis’s Broom (2023), at her gallery, Various Small Fires, in Hollywood.

(Baca says she is still responsible for preserving many of the public works she has overseen herself.) “It’s a way of teaching people about muralism,” she says of the LACMA show. “Murals are not taught in the university but it’s the oldest art form. It goes back to the cave painters. It’s been denigrated because, particularly in the city of L.A., we have not honored it, maintained it, and supported the continuation of it.”</p><span aria-hidden=true class="css-0 eagam8p0"></span>“I look out for artists who are predicting things 50 years into the future.”<p>Esther Kim Varet</p><span aria-hidden=true class="css-0 eagam8p1"></span><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=36 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">Identity and visibility are notions that EJ Hill and Martine Syms have each touched on in their work. Hill’s practice includes performance, painting, installation, and conceptual work that has focused, in part, on the relationship between oppressive structures and the body, meditating on endurance and struggle but also beauty and joy. For the Hammer Museum’s 2018 “Made in L.A.” biennial, Hill, who grew up in a tight-knit Belizean family in South Central, created an installation that included images of him running around schools he had attended (he called them “victory laps”) but where he didn’t always feel seen or accepted. All day, six days a week, for three months, he stood motionless and silent on a wooden podium in a gallery.</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=37 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">While attending Columbia College Chicago, Hill had become enthralled with the performance-based work of artists such as Marina Abramovic, Chris Burden, and Pope.L, who used their bodies in their art. “There is something I really connected to about looking at oneself, understanding one’s interior life, and thinking about your body as it relates to other bodies in the world and neighborhoods and cities and borders and communities,” he says. “I think I’ve always just been trying to find where I fit, where is home. And it was this space where I could ask all these questions about my position in the world, my subjectivity and how it bumps up against others as an embodied being, but also as a being that's more than just body.”</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=38 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">More recently, though, Hill has begun to explore the implications of his presence in other ways. His contribution to the 2022 Whitney Biennial consisted of a single blank pink page in the exhibition catalog. His first solo museum show, “Brake Run Helix,” on view through January at Mass MoCA in North Adams, Massachusetts, includes paintings of flowers as well as a functional roller coaster that visitors can ride. “The things that drew me to art and working creatively were that there was a sense of play and freedom in it, and I just want that spirit all the time,” Hill says. “I will say that there’s a lot of what I do in my creative and professional practice that I actively keep hidden and behind the scenes and that I don’t talk about to anyone other than close friends or people that I’m working with. That’s important to me because I don’t think everything needs to be posted and shared and liked and commented on. I’m maybe sounding like an elder millennial here, but I think some things can just be for you and the communities you work with.”<br></p><img alt="california african american museum executive director cameron shaw" title="california african american museum executive director cameron shaw" width=1800 height=2250 decoding=async data-nimg=1 sizes=100vw src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/hips.hearstapps.com/hmg-prod/images/hbz120123welllaart-024-wm-656cf1a3aa611.png style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center><span class="css-1urwh1q e1geg53v2">Andy Jackson</span><p>Cameron Shaw, executive director of the California African American Museum (CAAM), at artist Mark Bradford’s Art + Practice space in Leimert Park with Juan Erman Gonzalez’s The Last Mile (2004) and A La Rueda, Rueda&nbsp;(2019).

Like Halsey, her understanding of the city came from traversing different areas by bus. But few years ago, after moving out her apartment when the building she lived in was sold, Syms embarked on a period of shuttling from place to place, even spending some time in New York, and began to contemplate leaving L.A. entirely. Syms’s exhibition at Sprüth Magers in L.A. this past summer, “Loser Back Home,” used video, paintings, photography, and sculpture to look at the concept of “dysplacement,” a term coined by the historian Barbara J. Fields to describe the destruction of place and the loss of a sense of home.</p><span aria-hidden=true class="css-0 eagam8p0"></span>“I think a lot about sankofa, a Ghanaian word that translates as ‘to go back and get.’”<p>Cameron Shaw</p><span aria-hidden=true class="css-0 eagam8p1"></span><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=42 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">Syms’s work, which is frequently cinematic, includes pastiche of cultural references, from movies and music to memes and memories. One of her early inspirations for the show was a piece of graffiti she saw during the social-justice protests in 2020 that read, “You stole more than we could ever loot”—the notion that feelings of belonging or dislocation are both psychological and physical. It’s a thematic that Syms has explored in relation to the way identity is constructed in an increasingly digital and virtual world, often using herself as both a subject and vehicle. “A lot of it is just the way my brain processes things, weaving together different ideas,” she says. “I think I’ve come to put more of my life into my work over the years. But the texture of the references and the self-reflexiveness is very much a form of media studies, reading everything as a text, thinking about the relationship between texts that create subtext or para-text or that exist in the world, and thinking about the kinds of values or meanings that are circulating.”<br></p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=43 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">Syms’s own friends, influences, and experiences also often find their way into her art. In 2022, she directed her first feature-length film, The African Desperate, about an artist who is navigating racism and elitism in an MFA program. It stars her frequent collaborator, the artist Diamond Stingily, and is loosely inspired by Syms’s own time in art school. “It felt like a perspective that I wanted to talk about,” she says. “A lot of people in the movie are artists themselves so it was a continuation of that community and being part of the community that I’m in.”<br></p><img alt="laxart director hamza walker" title="laxart director hamza walker" width=1500 height=1875 decoding=async data-nimg=1 sizes=100vw src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/hips.hearstapps.com/hmg-prod/images/hbz120123welllaart-001-wm-656a269ec015e.png style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center><span class="css-1urwh1q e1geg53v2">Andy Jackson</span><p>LAXART director Hamza Walker at the 18-year-old nonprofit’s new permanent space in Melrose Hill.

Opie’s 2017 short film, The Modernist, tells the story of an artist (played by performance artist Stosh Fila, a.k.a. Pig Pen) who sets fire to several of L.A.’s prized midcentury-modern mansions, designed by architects like Richard Neutra and John Lautner, that grew out of a design mode originally intended to create low-cost housing. “L.A. has these really interesting roots in relationship to the idea of utopia that are also utterly about a dystopia that exists here as well,” says Opie, who retired last spring after serving on the faculty of the department of art at UCLA for 25 years. “The mix of immigration and class and Hollywood makes for such an interesting place to explore in relationship to its own identity because it doesn’t have a fixed identity either,” she explains. “We might say, ‘Oh, L.A. is iconic for its palm trees or its beaches or the Hollywood sign.’ But when you’re down in the city and roaming through it and participating in the actual grid that goes beyond these kinds of clichés, it’s an incredibly amazing place to think about in relationship to society and how we live our lives.”<br></p><span aria-hidden=true class="css-0 eagam8p0"></span>“An important part of Los Angeles is its state of becoming.”<p>Hamza Walker</p><span aria-hidden=true class="css-0 eagam8p1"></span><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=47 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">For Cameron Shaw, executive director of California African American Museum (CAAM), creating connections across geographies is one of the great challenges of L.A. “I’ve always really understood Los Angeles as rhizomatic and as this loosely connected series of neighborhood experiences,” she says. Last August, CAAM, a state-supported institution, was forced to close its building to repair damage caused by Tropical Storm Hilary. But thanks to a partnership forged during the pandemic, the museum has taken up residence at artist Mark Bradford’s nonprofit Art + Practice’s Leimert Park space, where it has continued to run exhibitions. Shaw also points to Covid-era activities at CAAM, such as its popular outdoor yoga classes, farmers’ markets, and wellness-oriented sound baths, as other dimensions of what the museum can offer. “What we’re doing in this moment—and have done for years—is really serving as a central hub for Black ideas and community gathering,” she says. “I think a lot about the spirit of sankofa, a Ghanaian word that translates as ‘to go back and get.’ That’s a deeply Indigenous African principle that tells us to look back at the past when preparing for our future.”<br></p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=48 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">The role that alternative spaces can play is also evolving. Over the past few years, a group including Crenshaw Dairy Mart, Gyopo, Human Resources, the Institute of Contemporary Art, Los Angeles, LAXART, Los Angeles Nomadic Division (LAND), and the Mistake Room formed the Los Angeles Visual Arts Coalition to coordinate efforts and resources. “There are rich, deep, generative cultural conversations to be had in meeting artists and community members and people where they are,” says Christine Y. Kim, the L.A.-based curator at large at London’s Tate Modern and a former curator at LACMA. Kim is also a cofounder of both LAND, a public-art initiative, and Gyopo, an educational nonprofit formed by culture workers of the Korean diaspora. Gyopo’s programs have included symposiums on anti-Asian hate and healing sessions after last January’s Half Moon Bay and Monterey Park shootings. “There are limited resources for small nonprofits, as we all know. But we all got together and said, ‘We all need the same things. How do we make our collective energy and our collective missions, which are diverse and about equity, connected?’” Kim says. “I think it very much speaks to the cultural landscape in L.A., where nothing is monolithic.”<br></p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=49 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">This spring, the 18-year-old LAXART, which was established in 2005 to support emerging artists, will move into its first permanent home, on Western Avenue in Melrose Hill, a block south of David Zwirner, and have a new name and an expanded mission. “We’re getting a makeover in full,” says LAXART director Hamza Walker, who, before coming to the organization in 2016, spent more than two decades at the Renaissance Society in Chicago. To that end, Walker is in the process of curating a new exhibition under the auspices of LAXART in collaboration with the Museum of Contemporary Art and the artist Kara Walker (no relation) of a group of decommissioned Confederate monuments and newly commissioned pieces created in response to them.</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=50 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">The show, currently scheduled to open in 2025, is an example of the kind of big cultural swing Walker wants to see LAXART take. “It’s about asking the question, ‘How contemporary can contemporary art be?’—to use contemporary art, not as an end in itself, but the means to an end to try to make sense out of the issues and events of the moment,” he says. And while Walker says having a more solid base of operations (and the equity that comes with it) is transformative for LAXART as an organization, he wants to continue to think beyond it. “Don’t think through your physical space. Think about what matters. Let’s talk about the world. That’s our mission.”</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=51 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">To Walker, one of the defining characteristics of L.A. is its protean quality—that it’s always growing and changing, often in unexpected ways. “I’m still figuring it out, how to tack the waters, but at the same time, L.A. is also figuring itself out,” he explains. “An important part of Los Angeles is its state of becoming. And even though one chapter is closing, a new chapter feels like it’s starting,” he says. “It’s a new L.A.”</p><h2 data-node-id=53 class="body-h4 css-3zjk8x emevuu60">A version of this story originally appeared in the December 2023/January 2024 issue of Harper’s Bazaar.</h2><h2 data-node-id=55 class="body-h4 css-3zjk8x emevuu60">For Baca, hair: Sully Lavo for Innerspace Organic Beauty; makeup: Sara Tagaloa for Gucci Beauty.
