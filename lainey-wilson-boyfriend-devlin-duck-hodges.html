Rams. The Samford University grad and Alabama native then played one season in the Canadian Football League with the Ottawa Redblacks.</p><p>Wondering why they call him "Duck"?</p><figure class="img-tag has-sizer aligncenter" readability=2><p><span class=visually-hidden>attachment-Lainey wilson Duck</span></p>Jason Kempin, Getty Images<p>loading...</p></figure><p>In college, and then with the Steelers, he couldn't quit talking about duck hunting, so the coach just started calling him that, and it stuck. <a href=#>ESPN</a> shared a meaty profile on the QB in 2019 that goes into his record-setting collegiate career.</p><p>He's quite the prolific hunter. Find several photos of his haul in Instagram, including this one shared on Jan. 31, 2024:</p><p>We found pictures of Wilson and Hodges on the red carpet together.

She did bring her father to the 2022 CMA Awards, but she's dodged questions about her love life, other than talking about her steamy on-screen kiss with Ian Bohen during Season 5 of Yellowstone.</p><p><strong>Related</strong>: <a href=#>Yellowstone: Lainey Wilson Had Rules for Kissing Ian Bohen</a></p><p>In 2024, Hodges and Wilson haven't walked the red carpet together, but he was spotted with her at the People's Choice Awards in February, and he did share a sweet pic celebrating her Grammy win a month earlier. Both events were a bit of a respite for him.</p><p>"I put him to work," Wilson tells Taste of Country ahead of the&nbsp;<a href=#>2023 CMA Awards</a>. "Girl, look, he's got a long list of things.

Although it's unclear when their romance began, the pair made their first pubic appearance together at the 2023 ACM Awards. Then, they attended the CMA Awards together that fall.</p><p>Wilson has spoken very little about Hodges, but she did share that she's not afraid to put him to work around her home in Nashville.</p>"I put him to work," Wilson told <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Taste of Country</a> ahead of the&nbsp;2023 CMA Awards.
