<span>Jenniffer Sheldon</span></p><h1>How to Fix &amp;quot;Undoing Changes to Your Computer&amp;quot; in Windows 11</h1></header><section class=post-content><p>Windows frequently rolls out updates to fix issues based on feedback from users. However, <a href=#>Windows Update often fails</a> because of several reasons, and one such issue is when Windows tells you that it's "undoing changes to your compute."</p><p>This error can be a result of several issues. For instance, if the Windows Update service stops while the update is still installing, Windows might try to undo the changes because it can't continue the installation. It's also possible that your SoftwareDistribution folder has become corrupt and is preventing Windows from installing the updates properly. Fortunately, fixing the error isn't all that difficult, so let's check out all the solutions.</p><strong class=ad-zone-advertising-tag></strong><h2 id=try-booting-into-safe-mode>1. Try Booting Into Safe Mode</h2><p>If you're stuck in a boot loop, you may not be able to use your Windows properly to apply any fixes. As such, before you start trying to fix your PC, boot into the Safe Mode.</p><p>There are several methods of <a href=#>booting into Safe Mode</a>. However, if you can't boot into Windows, you'll need to use the Windows Recovery Environment.</p><p>Hard reboot your PC two times consecutively (don't worry, hard reboots aren't harmful) to enter Windows Recovery Environment and navigate to <strong>Troubleshoot > Advanced Options > Startup Settings > Restart</strong>. Once your PC restarts, you'll need to choose one of the advanced boot options by pressing one of the corresponding numbers. Ideally, press 5, which is Safe Mode with Networking.</p><strong class=ad-zone-advertising-tag></strong><p>Once you're in Safe Mode, you can start applying the fixes.</p><h2 id=uninstall-recently-installed-updates>2. Uninstall Recently Installed Updates</h2><p>By manually removing updates, you're helping Windows do what it was trying to by getting rid of any updates installed during the last update session. To uninstall recently installed updates, press <strong>Win + R</strong>, type <strong>appwiz.cpl</strong>, and press <strong>Enter</strong>.</p><p>You'll now see the <strong>Programs and Features</strong> section of the Control Panel. Click <strong>View installed updates</strong> from the left.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static1.makeuseofimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2022/01/view-updates.png><p>Click on the <strong>Install On</strong> tab to sort updates according to the date of installation. Select all recently installed updates and click <strong>Uninstall</strong>.</p><strong class=ad-zone-advertising-tag></strong> <img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static1.makeuseofimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2022/01/uninstall-updates.png><p>Once you've uninstalled all recent updates, restart your PC normally.</p><h2 id=delete-the-softwaredistribution-folder>3. Delete the SoftwareDistribution Folder</h2><p>Whenever you update Windows, the Windows Update agent (also known as WUAgent) uses the SoftwareDistribution folder to temporarily store installation files. If the folder has become corrupt or otherwise is keeping the Windows from updating properly, you can try deleting the folder and see if that helps.</p><p>Navigate to C:\Windows and look for the SoftwareDistribution folder. Click on it and press <strong>Shift + Delete</strong> to delete it permanently. Once you restart the PC, Windows will automatically recreate the folder.</p><strong class=ad-zone-advertising-tag></strong> <img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static1.makeuseofimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2022/01/software-distribution.png><p>If you're unable to delete the folder, try stopping the Windows Update Service and Background Intelligent Transfer Services. You can do this using the Command Prompt. Press <strong>Win + R</strong>, type <strong>cmd</strong>, and press <strong>Ctrl + Shift + Enter</strong>. Then, run the following commands one-by-one (i.e., press <strong>Enter</strong> after each one):</p><p>w</p><pre>net stop wuauserv <p>net stop bits</p></pre><p>Once you've stopped these services, try to delete the folder again and you should be able to. Then, restart your PC normally to see if the fix worked.</p><strong class=ad-zone-advertising-tag></strong><h2 id=run-the-windows-update-troubleshooter>4. Run the Windows Update Troubleshooter</h2><p>Windows has several built-in troubleshooters, including for issues related to Windows Update. If the previous two fixes didn't work for you, it's worth giving the troubleshooter a shot to check if it can automatically fix the problem.</p><p><span class=related-single><strong>Related:</strong> <a href=#>Windows Has Built-In Troubleshooters for These Common Problems</a></span></p><p>On Windows 11, press <strong>Ctrl + I</strong> to launch the <strong>Settings</strong> app and navigate to <strong>System > Troubleshoot > Other troubleshooters</strong>. Look for <strong>Windows Update</strong> and click on the <strong>Run</strong> button next to it.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static1.makeuseofimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2022/01/windows-troubleshooters.png><p>The troubleshooter will try and identify issues with Windows Update. If possible, the troubleshooter will try fixing the issues automatically. Otherwise, it will let you know about issues that it couldn't fix or that it didn't find any issues.</p><h2 id=use-system-restore>5. Use System Restore</h2><p>System Restore is basically a time travel mechanism for your Windows. It will revert your PC to a state that it was in when you created a specific restore point.</p><p>However, the most common problem with this method is that a lot of people don't have a system restore point. Windows doesn't create restore points by default, so unless you've set up Windows to automatically create restore points or <a href=#>created a restore point yourself</a>, you won't have one on your system.</p><strong class=ad-zone-advertising-tag></strong><p>You can check if you have a restore point from the System Restore wizard. Search for <strong>Recovery</strong> in your Start Menu and launch the Best Match. Select <strong>Open System Restore</strong> from the window that pops open.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static1.makeuseofimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2022/01/recovery-window.png><p>You'll now see the System Restore wizard on your screen. Click the <strong>Next</strong> button. This is where you'll see your restore points, if any exist on your system. If you don't have a restore point, skip to the next method. However, if you do have a restore point that was created before you encountered the undoing changes error the first time, select it and click <strong>Next</strong>.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static1.makeuseofimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2022/01/system-restore-points.png><p>On the next screen, confirm that you want to restore your PC using the restore point and let the process complete. Once you're done, you'll most likely have fixed the issue.</p><h2 id=reset-windows>6. Reset Windows</h2><p>If you're still facing the undoing changes issue, you might want to consider resetting your PC. If you want Windows in mint condition, you can choose to remove everything, but you do have the option to keep your files intact. Whichever option you choose, it's always good to backup your data in case something doesn't go as planned.</p><strong class=ad-zone-advertising-tag></strong><p>Press <strong>Win + I</strong> to launch the <strong>Settings</strong> app and navigate to <strong>System > Recovery</strong>. Click on the <strong>Reset PC</strong> button to start the reset process.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static1.makeuseofimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2022/01/reset-pc-button.png><p>This will launch the reset wizard. If you want to retain your personal files, choose to <strong>Keep my files</strong>, or choose to <strong>Remove everything</strong> otherwise. Note that in either case, you'll need to reinstall all programs on your PC.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static1.makeuseofimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2022/01/keep-remove-files.png><p>Follow the wizard and let the process complete. At this point, you should be able to use your PC like before.</p><h2 id=changes-finally-undone>Changes Finally Undone</h2><p>With each of these methods, we're effectively undoing the changes that the faulty Windows Update attempt had made. This isn't the only issue that Windows Update can cause. There are several problems associated with Windows Update, but they're usually easy to fix.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7rq3KnqysnZ%2Bbe6S7zGiuoqaUpMS0eZBqZJ%2BhqGLCr7DOoqWgZZOdrq%2BzxKxkraddrry2voycpqaopamys3s%3D</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./article-17eb7f12-0473-11ed-9c2c-a738a421e3de-html.html><span>←</span><span>COLUMN: Killing off an icon | Opinion</span></a>
