How did I ever deal with that? Why did I ever wear that? What was I thinking with <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=internalLink data-ordinal=1>that haircut</a>? Mistakes like that are a part of life — we live and we learn, after all. But there’s one mistake I’m so done making, and I only wish I had known about <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=internalLink data-ordinal=2>this hack</a> earlier in my life. It would have <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=internalLink data-ordinal=3>prevented a lot of pain</a> — literally, and I'm stocking up on all-things foot health while some staples are marked down during <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=internalLink data-ordinal=4>Amazon's Big Spring Sale</a>, which ends tonight.&nbsp;</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_3-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">Said hack? <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=externalLink data-ordinal=1 rel="sponsored nofollow noskim">Fulton’s game-changing insoles</a>. And before you grimace your face and say, “insoles are for old people,” I suggest you give them a try. Sure, insoles might be “unsexy,” but that doesn’t make them any less essential, and it’s never too soon to <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=internalLink data-ordinal=2>focus on foot health</a>. In fact, you’ll probably be able to prevent a lot of pain points if you start adding them into your routine ASAP.&nbsp;</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_5-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">By now, you know I’m <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=internalLink data-ordinal=1>a self-proclaimed shoe obsessive</a>. If I had to choose shoes over a handbag, shoes would win by a landslide, but just because I love them doesn’t mean I’ve always made the best decisions about them. I’ve worn my fair share of bad footwear that ultimately led to some major pains, but <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=externalLink data-ordinal=2 rel="sponsored nofollow noskim">Fulton's insoles</a> have transformed even my most uncomfortable shoes into a pair suitable for 20,000 steps. Seriously.</p><figure id=mntl-sc-block_7-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block instyle-sc-block-image mntl-sc-block-universal-image mntl-sc-block-image--no-theme no-theme mntl-sc-block-image figure-landscape figure-high-res"><span class=figure-article-caption-owner><p>Fulton</p></span></figure><p id=mntl-sc-block_12-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">Let me preface with this: I’ve never used <a href=# data-component=amazon data-source=affiliate data-type=externalLink data-ordinal=1 rel="sponsored nofollow noskim">other insoles prior to Fulton’s</a>, but I’ve heard that some can be kind of complicated. Fulton’s aren’t. There’s no initial trimming or shaping required; you simply buy your normal shoe size and pop them right into your shoes. They’re also built with what the brand calls “custom-molding technology,” which is a fancy way to say that they’ll mold to your unique foot shape and walking style.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_14-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">After adding the insoles into my routine, I noticed that I could comfortably stay on my feet all day, as opposed to before, when I felt foot fatigue within hours after being out and about. I also didn’t have my usual back pain, which I always just assumed was a result of sitting at my desk all day. Turns out, it was because of my non-supportive shoes.&nbsp;</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_16-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">Living in New York, I obviously walk a lot, which means <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=internalLink data-ordinal=1>I own many sneakers</a> — seeing as I’m a sucker for stylish heels and cool booties, my collection runs the gamut. Naturally, I’ve tested Fulton’s insoles on various styles, inserting them in everything from sneakers to boots. The end result is the same: ultra-comfy shoes that I can easily walk 20,000 steps in.&nbsp;</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_18-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">Worth mentioning, the insoles work best with shoes that come with removable insoles and there are two types: <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=externalLink data-ordinal=1 rel="sponsored nofollow noskim">the classic</a> that can be used on any shoe and <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=externalLink data-ordinal=2 rel="sponsored nofollow noskim">the athletic</a> for your running sneakers. Shop them below, along with a few other essentials that I'm grabbing ASAP before <a href=# data-component=amazon data-source=affiliate data-type=externalLink data-ordinal=3 rel="sponsored nofollow noskim">Amazon's Big Spring Sale</a> ends tonight.</p><figure id=mntl-sc-block_20-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block instyle-sc-block-image mntl-sc-block-universal-image mntl-sc-block-image--no-theme no-theme mntl-sc-block-image figure-landscape figure-high-res"><span class=figure-article-caption-owner><p>Amazon</p></span></figure><figure id=mntl-sc-block_23-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block instyle-sc-block-image mntl-sc-block-universal-image mntl-sc-block-image--no-theme no-theme mntl-sc-block-image figure-landscape figure-high-res"><span class=figure-article-caption-owner><p>Amazon</p></span></figure><figure id=mntl-sc-block_26-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block instyle-sc-block-image mntl-sc-block-universal-image mntl-sc-block-image--no-theme no-theme mntl-sc-block-image figure-landscape figure-high-res"><span class=figure-article-caption-owner><p>Amazon</p></span></figure><figure id=mntl-sc-block_29-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block instyle-sc-block-image mntl-sc-block-universal-image mntl-sc-block-image--no-theme no-theme mntl-sc-block-image figure-landscape figure-high-res"><span class=figure-article-caption-owner><p>Fulton</p></span></figure><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7qrrSrbClnV6YvK57xa6jraeeYravv86lnGaqlau2psOMcGdybGZnhg%3D%3D</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./halle-berry-and-50-cent.html><span>←</span><span>Halle Berry and 50 Cent</span></a>
