"So it's a little win for teenage anorexic me."</p><a class="article-block__link js-track-link" href=# data-node-ref=toofab:article:dde20648-cf1a-5303-bdc8-d448e89e431e data-container-ref=toofab:article:adaffd02-deb3-5879-93ef-0cb40b5b9733 data-context='{"section":"article-block","name":"article"}' readability=27><img src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/images.toofab.com/image/a5/5by4/2019/08/01/a54088d294a65c849f5d1425653f4608_xs.jpg width=300 height=240 style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center> <span class="media-credit article-block__media-credit">Getty</span><p><h4 class="article-block__card-title article-block__card-title--has-credit">Jameela Jamil: How Loneliness Contributed to Her Eating Disorder As a Teen</h4><span class=article-block__cta-text>View Story</span></p></a><p>Jamil then suggested her followers "tag someone" who might need to see the message. "We can break out of this prison of self hate together," she continued. "I love to expose all the shit that happens in this industry, to make us all feel sad, so you can see that it's not you who is the problem, it's THEM."</p><p>Jamil concluded, "To any other actors, influencers or models that follow me, please join me in this and fight back against the use of airbrushing that makes others try to reach standards that we ourselves can't meet... ❤️ #freethebackfat."</p><p>On Saturday, the native Brit added another tweet, where she again relayed her message to other stars in Hollywood.</p><p>"I know it's hard because we are perpetually scrutinized and criticized in this industry, but I'm begging other influencers, actors, and models to join me in not allowing airbrushing," Jamil tweeted. "We have to stop setting standards for others that we ourselves don't even meet. #letabitchlive"</p><p lang=en dir=ltr>I know it's hard because we are perpetually scrutinized and criticized in this industry, but I'm begging other influencers, actors, and models to join me in not allowing airbrushing.

She also has been an <a href=#><strong>vocal critic</strong></a> against celebrities including <a href=#><strong>Kim</strong></a> and <a href=#><strong>Khloe Kardashian</strong></a> supporting and advertising detox teas.</p><p>Earlier this month, Jamil opened up to <a href=#><strong>People</strong></a> about the "radical inclusivity" platform she created called <a href=#><strong>I Weigh</strong></a>, which has caught the eyes of many celebrities, including <a href=#><strong>Sam Smith</strong></a>. Jamil said she uses some of the program's techniques for building confidence -- like making lists of her accomplishments and personality traits. She also doesn't look in the mirror.</p><p>"The only time I look in the mirror is when I put on my eyeliner in the morning and when I take it off at night," Jamil said. "I'm not interested in my appearance. I still suffer from body dysmorphia so it can be very distracting for me. Doing that has helped me concentrate on progressing and doing things that enrich my life, like watching my career grow and my relationships grow. That's what gives me a wonderful sense of self."</p><p><strong>Got a story or a tip for us?
