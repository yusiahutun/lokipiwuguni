There's a similar twang, even if they grew up on opposite sides of the Tennessee/North Carolina border. This song is Church's first radio&nbsp;single since the Top 40 hit "Doing Life With Me" from 2022. The previous year's "Heart&nbsp;on Fire" is the last time he hit Top 5 on airplay charts.</p><p><strong>Did You Know?</strong>: Church joined Wallen for this song from his One Thing&nbsp;at a Time album, but he also wrote "Quittin' Time" for Wallen's Dangerous: The Double Album.</p><h2>Listen to Morgan Wallen and Eric Church, "Man Made a Bar":</h2><h3>Morgan Wallen and Eric Church, "Man Made a Bar" Lyrics:</h3><p><strong>Morgan Wallen:</strong><br>I sat down on a barstool, like a darn fool / 'Cause she walked out again / Bartender said, I got you / Yeah, 'cause I, too, have been in your boots, my friend / Opened up back in '85, got me over my first wife / Been stayin' busy since the first night / It's a story old as time.</p><p><strong>Chorus:</strong><br>God made the world in seven short days / He said it was good, I bet it was great / And God made a man, the man got lonely / He said, “Please, Lord, if I could only have an angel to hold in my arms / So God made a girl, his best work of art / Oh, but he didn't make no place to go when she breaks your heart / So man madе a bar.</p><p><strong>Eric Church:</strong><br>For some guys it's a good time / The half pricе, half dozen buckets of beer / Some say it's a cover band, that's a cover man / I know why they're here / It didn't go the way he planned it / Damn, the devil did some damage.</p><p><strong>Repeat Chorus:</strong></p><p>Sometimes an angel falls too hard / Loses more than just a piece of her heart / And she needs a place to go and make a brand new start</p><p><strong>Repeat Chorus</strong></p><figure class="img-tag has-sizer aligncenter" readability=2><p><span class=visually-hidden>attachment-Man Made a Bar</span></p>Big Loud Records<p>loading...</p></figure><h2 class=photogallery-title>The Top 40 Country Songs of 2023, Ranked</h2><p>The best country songs of 2023 fit snugly over your life and experiences.
