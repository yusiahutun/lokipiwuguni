Like, I don't want to be married anymore." Kody is also spotted snapping at Janelle, before she tells him to "Shut your f---ing mouth and let me talk to you for a minute." With that, he storms out of their conversation, saying he's done listening to her while she exclaimed, "F--- you!"</p><p>According to Janelle, "everybody's angry" on the new season, as Kody admits he's in "this bad place with Janelle and Christine's gone," adding that he also doesn't "know what to do with Meri."</p><a class="article-block__link js-track-link" href=# data-node-ref=toofab:article:afc2a1b9-d42c-4267-bafa-f5ce19666fa9 data-container-ref=toofab:article:64553a6e-d50a-4c54-81ce-cbf861eedb82 data-context='{"section":"article-block","name":"article"}' readability=27><img src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/images.toofab.com/image/cf/5by4/2023/05/05/cf52c541ce404b1e8f854ac87f1f9beb_xs.jpg width=300 height=240 style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center> <span class="media-credit article-block__media-credit">Getty</span><p><h4 class="article-block__card-title article-block__card-title--has-credit">Kody Brown's Kids Who Have Spoken Out Against Him</h4><span class=article-block__cta-text>View Story</span></p></a><p>Meri, for her part, at least starts the season by saying she still has "hope" for her future with Kody -- telling him, "I don't want you to think I'm walking away." Later, however, she tells Robyn that she believes Jody is "done with me."</p><p>"This is not the happy go lucky Kody brown that I used to know," she says at another point, before sitting down with both Kody and Meri to tell them, "I just wanted to let you know I'm not going to be around. It's not what I want."</p><p>Robyn breaks down in tears upon hearing this, reiterating her dream scenario where she and her sister wives would spend their golden years sitting together on a porch "with our kids and our grandkids," a dream which no longer seems possible.</p><a class="article-block__link js-track-link" href=# data-node-ref=toofab:article:35c52230-2ded-4aa4-9df0-ef7a01bb6014 data-container-ref=toofab:article:64553a6e-d50a-4c54-81ce-cbf861eedb82 data-context='{"section":"article-block","name":"article"}' readability=29><img src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/images.toofab.com/image/6a/5by4/2023/04/24/6ad568bfe2d5496bb8fd4739600c20db_xs.jpg width=300 height=240 style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center> <span class="media-credit article-block__media-credit">Youtube/Instagram</span><p><h4 class="article-block__card-title article-block__card-title--has-credit">Sister Wives' Gwendlyn Brown Calls Robyn's Behavior 'Manipulative,' Doesn't Think Family Can Reunite</h4><span class=article-block__cta-text>View Story</span></p></a><p>Kody's own kids seem to confirm her fears, as his son with Janelle, Garrison, is also seen saying, "You know what, Robyn, have him. We're all grown adults that don't need a father figure anymore."</p><p>According to TLC, the new season will show Kody "still grappling with the fallout from his divorce with Christine, and he is struggling in many of his other relationships."</p><p>"Christine, however, is learning to love who she is on her own by planning trips and celebrations along the way. Robyn is the only wife secure in her marriage yet devastated that her original dream of a big, happy polygamist family is falling apart," the synopsis continues. "Meri is steadily coming to realize that Kody isn't going to have the change of heart she has been waiting for and makes a life-changing decision. Lastly, Kody has been spending less and less time at Janelle's house, and, after an explosive fight, she kicks him out. Through their transparency and vulnerability, the Browns shed light on the hardships their family is struggling to overcome."</p><p>The show returns August 20 on TLC.</p><a class="article-block__link js-track-link" href=# data-node-ref=toofab:article:0c73fc9a-0937-46e4-be9c-94f452a6c69c data-container-ref=toofab:article:64553a6e-d50a-4c54-81ce-cbf861eedb82 data-context='{"section":"article-block","name":"article"}' readability=27><img src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/images.toofab.com/image/9f/5by4/2023/02/22/9f374d7fd1bb4939bffe61383e453f1a_xs.jpg width=300 height=240 style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center> <span class="media-credit article-block__media-credit">Instagram</span><p><h4 class="article-block__card-title article-block__card-title--has-credit">Sister Wives' Gwendlyn Brown Says Trans Sibling Leon Distancing From Family</h4><span class=article-block__cta-text>View Story</span></p></a><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmisn6Szoq6NnKamZ2Jlf3R7j3BmamtfqLa0wMSrZLChpprAbrrEsGSsnZGovK9506uYoqSVp3w%3D</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./shocking-moment-suspect-charges-officer-lunges-gun-cop-shoots-kills-neighbor-screamed-killing-woman-html.html><span>←</span><span>Shocking moment suspect charges officer and lunges for his gun before cop shoots and kills him after</span></a>
