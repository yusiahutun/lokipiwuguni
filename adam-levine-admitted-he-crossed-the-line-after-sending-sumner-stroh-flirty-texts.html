Sumner Stroh recorded the clip after a friend attempted to sell screenshots of messages with Adam Levine to tabloids, trying to give her side of the story before it got out of control. However, she later came out to apologize wishing she had hindsight before the story went viral.</p><figure class="wp-block-grvmedia-grv-video GRVMultiVideo"></figure><h2 class=wp-block-heading id=h-model-s-tiktok-video-goes-viral>Model’s TikTok video goes viral</h2><p>Sumner Stroh’s video claimed she had a year-long affair with <a href=#>music</a> star Adam Levine – which he vehemently denied the next day. The <a href=#>Instagram</a> model shared screenshots of messages exchanged between the two, where the music star complimented on how she looked.</p><p>In the alleged messages, he said: “It is truly unreal how f**king hot you are like it blows my mind. …You are 50 times hotter in person and so am I hahaha.”</p><p>She said a while later he came back to ask her if he had a baby boy with his wife, if he could name the child Sumner – her name.</p><p>Sumner took to recording a video because she didn’t want the story going out there without her giving her side.</p><p>She said: “I only came forward because I wanted to kill whatever story the tabloids had.”</p><p>After it went viral and made headlines around the world she apologized.</p><p>“I was under the impression their marriage was over… being naïve is not an excuse for the role I played in this,” she added, “I’m not the one who’s really getting hurt here. It’s Behati and her children, and, for that I’m so, so sorry.”</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading id=h-adam-levine-denied-having-an-affair-with-sumner-stroh>Adam Levine denied having an affair with Sumner Stroh</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/cdn1.celebritytidbit.com/uploads/39/2024/03/GettyImages-1353207856-1024x682.jpg><p>The next day, after the story got out of control, the singer released a statement to squash the rumors he had an affair. But Adam Levine did admit he had sent ‘flirty’ messages with Sumner Stroh, but regrets it.</p><p>He said: “A lot is being said about me right now and I want to clear the air.</p><p>“I used poor judgement in speaking with anyone other than my wife in ANY kind&nbsp;of flirtatious manner. I did not have an affair, nevertheless, I crossed the line during a regrettable period of my life.”</p><p>The 45-year-old added: “I have addressed that and taken proactive steps to remedy this with my family.</p><p>“My wife and my family is all I care about in this world. To be this naive and stupid enough to risk the only thing that truly matters to me was my greatest mistake I could ever make. I will never make it again. I take full responsibility.</p><p>“We will get through it and we will get through it together.”</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading id=h-model-speaks-out-year-later>Model speaks out year later</h2><p>Following the texting scandal with Adam Levine, Sumner Stroh did reflect on the ordeal the following year.</p><p>She said her “life changed overnight” and it was “scary”.</p><p>The 24-year-old <a href=# rel=nofollow>told</a> InTouch: “It was just hard to even try and plan something to come back from this.”</p><p>“I was thrown into this, and I think that I want to move on from that,” she added, announcing she was releasing a single.</p><p>Sumner continued: “I just wanted to talk about the criticism that I faced. I think that rather than harp on the past, I wanna move forward and create change for other people to make a better future for women in general.”</p><p>Related Topics</p><p>MORE CELEBRITY STORIES</p><span></span><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7pLHLnpmroaSuwaqwwaKrZ5ufonxzfJFtZmlrX2aFcK3DmqRmpJWrtq%2BxjJqbpqGkqbKleceeZJyqn6jAprCMrZ%2BeZZyeu6Z5wJ%2BrnqpdqLKvsMinnmarpaK7pr6MrKurp5his6210a2wZqyVrcG0ew%3D%3D</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./nia-longs-street-brawl.html><span>←</span><span> Nia Long's Street Brawl</span></a>
