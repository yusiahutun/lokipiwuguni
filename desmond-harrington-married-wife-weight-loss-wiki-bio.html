Read on to find out more…</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading><strong>Desmond Harrington Wiki/Bio</strong></h2><p>Desmond Harrington was born on 19 October 1976 in Savannah, Georgia, USA. He spent the first years of his life in the Bronx, New York. After high school, Desmond attended college in Manhattan but failed to graduate.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/celebily.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/09/Desmond-Harrington-640x428.jpg><p>He then began working as a landscape gardener, worker, and cold canvasser in a brokerage firm. While working as a bartender, a colleague encouraged him to enroll in acting classes. And there was the beginning of his journey to the Hollywood star.</p><p><strong>ALSO READ: <a href=#>Heather Childers Bio, Married, Husband, Wiki, Family, Measurements</a></strong></p><p>Harrington received his first role in 1999 in Luc Besson’s epic historical drama film The Messenger: The Story of Joan of Arc. Although the film was confronted with lukewarm reviews and poorly box office at night, earning only $7 million over its $60 million budget, it was a good debut for Harrington.</p><p>He got an unpraised role in the Boiler Room in 2000. In 2001 he played Bobby in the biographical film “Riding in Cars with Boys”.</p><p>Desmond got his first big role as Mike Steel player in the British horror movie “The Hole” in 2001. The film also gave Keira Knightley her first major role in a feature film.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/celebily.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/desmond-harrington-1.jpg><p>In 2002, Harrington appeared in the American-Australian horror film Ghost Ship, which was a box-office hit and brought in over 68.3 million dollars from a budget of 20 million dollars.</p><p>Horror movies seemed to work well for him. As a result, he got a role in another horror movie, Wrong Turn (2003). The success of the film led him to develop into a film series with 5 episodes after the first installation.</p><p>In the world of the small screen, Desmond made his debut with Steven Spielberg’s science-fiction drama Taken, in which he played in three episodes. His later TV appearances included: Dragnet, Sons & Töchter, and Rescue Me.</p><p>His biggest role on the small screen, however, came in Dexter, a crime series that was shown on Showtime from 2008 to 2013. During his time with Dexter, Harrington played a role in the very popular CW series Gossip Girl and played Jack Bass, Chuck Bass’ manipulative uncle.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/celebily.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/09/desmond-harrington.jpg><p>Desmond played a supporting role in the 2012 superhero movie “The Dark Knight Rises”, which was the second Batman movie to make over $1 billion at the global box office.</p><p>Harrington remains active on both the big screen and the small screen. Perhaps his most successful film is Dexter, which earned him a nomination for the 4 Screen Guild Awards for the outstanding performance of an ensemble in a drama series.</p><p><strong>ALSO READ: <a href=#>Audrey Esparza’s Age, Wiki, Bio, Height, Measurements, Married</a></strong></p><h2 class=wp-block-heading><strong>Desmond Harrington Weight Loss</strong></h2><p>From the 5th season of Dexter, the fans noticed Desmond’s thinner and carved figure. As expected, this triggered rumors among the fans of the TV series. Keywords like Desmond Harrington’s weight loss were often searched on Google. Many speculated that the actor had undergone plastic surgery, while others feared that he could be plagued by a life-threatening illness or even dependent on hard drugs.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/celebily.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/Desmond-Harrington-limitless.jpg><p>In others to suppress the rumors, Desmond himself addressed the weight loss rumors that say he only ate healthier. Per<strong> <a href=# rel="nofollow noopener">Dexter daily</a></strong>, he said;</p><p>“I had no plastic surgery, I’m not sick, it’s called walking and eating better! Do you understand? I am now in my 30s. All those ridiculous things I read: “He’s sick, he’s on drugs”, take a life! I just changed how I ate and start running!</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading><strong>Married, Wife</strong></h2><p>Desmond is one of those hyper-secret celebrities who try to keep their names out of the tabloids as much as possible, much to the frustration of fans and admirers. This makes it difficult to know what is going on in his personal life.</p><p>Desmond doesn’t even have a social media account known to us. According to our investigation, a Twitter account @dezharrington registered in his name is fake. No details are known about his Instagram account either.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/celebily.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/Desmond-Harrington-weightloss.jpg><p>Sometime in 2012 <strong><a href=# rel="nofollow noopener">Daily</a><a href=# rel="nofollow noopener"> Mail</a> </strong>was able to steal paparazzi snapshots of him with his then-girlfriend Veronica Mars actress Amanda Seyfried. Unfortunately, the romance was only short-lived when they split up in 2013, with the reason that remained hidden from the media.</p><p>Amanda then found love in the eyes of the actor, Thomas Sadoski. They<a href=# rel="nofollow noopener"> met set while shooting</a> “The Way We Get By”.</p><p>While Amanda is not afraid to pass on details of her personal life to the fans via the social network, Desmond is exactly the opposite. From 2014 it was rumored that he was in a relationship with social media star Gabbie Hanna of the Gabbie Show. The rumors began to spread after Gabbie made that tweet;</p><p>Desmond Harrington is everything I want</p><p>— daddy (@TheGabbieShow)&nbsp;<a href=# rel=noopener>May 29, 2014</a></p><p>However, that rumor has never been confirmed as true or debunked as false, leaving more mystery behind Harrington’s personal life.</p><p><strong>Desmond Harrington’s height is 5 feet 11 inches (1.8 m).</strong></p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmiblaGyo7XLsmWcp51ksaa%2FzKilnWWYlr%2Bztc2gq6imXaKus77Inptmr5mbsm7DxKKeoaxdoby0v4ywoKShXZe2sHs%3D</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./article-b44ef246-e3bb-5886-8941-63aa8429cc04-html.html><span>←</span><span>Sylva Bay Academy third nine-week honor rolls | Education</span></a>
