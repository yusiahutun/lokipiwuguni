In a lengthy post on Weibo, she described the movie as “a profound work based on solid social reality”.&nbsp;</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">Li said that besides gender inequality, the film also explored the conflict between filial piety and individualism in a modernised society.&nbsp;</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">“So it becomes a Hamletian dilemma … should we pursue individual values, or sacrifice them for our families? The film has placed its protagonist in a violent ethical and emotional conflict, which is thought-provoking,” she wrote.&nbsp;</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">The movie is also a coming-out party for Yin and You, who were unknown by mainstream film-goers before&nbsp;My Sister.&nbsp;</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tK%2FMqWWcp51ku6bD0minnqegobJur9Slq66qlWSus8DInKOeZ2Nmf3mAlWtmn6Gconqirs6uq2abmJ67pr%2FEZqqom5mawbq%2FjKmpnp6Vp7Kvr8Rmmaixo2Kvpq3TrGSgp5Svtq24wGatrA%3D%3D</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./dolly-parton-favorite-line-my-tennessee-mountain-home-html.html><span>←</span><span>Dolly Partons Favorite Line in My Tennessee Mountain Home</span></a>
