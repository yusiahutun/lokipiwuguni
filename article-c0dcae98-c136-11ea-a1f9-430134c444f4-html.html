He was a passionate science teacher who brought complicated concepts to life for his students and, as an at home meteorologist, particularly enjoyed teaching about the weather. When he was not in the classroom, you could find him with his family — fishing at Lake Eddins, cheering at a Southern Miss game or relaxing in the Great Smoky Mountains. Randy was an active member of Phalti Baptist Church in Jasper County.</p><p>Randy was preceded in death by his father Berlin Rivers and his mother Pauline Rivers.</p><p>He is survived by his loving wife of 12 years Shelley Rivers; his children Kayci Reyer, James Rivers (Addie) and McKenzie Rivers; his grandson Theo Rivers; his sister Virginia Lowery (Jimmy); and a host of aunts, uncles and cousins.</p><p>Pallbearers will be Leslie Tisdale, Todd Smith, Rich Gray, Frank Slay, Kris Pierce and Tojo White. Honorary pallbearers will be David Wade, Jesse Hudson, Anthony Hutchinson and Chris Rivers.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7rbHAnZyrZZOWua16wqikaKeSnsG2rdGinKxnopa7pcWMpbCnpl2ntrex0axmmqqknrCtsb6cZ52bkZqGeXnCampvZWFmsqJ5wGqdcmVkaH1yf5Oca21slml7qcDMpQ%3D%3D</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./rachel-zeglers-cryptic-six-word-response-after-snow-white-movie-backlash.html><span>←</span><span>Rachel Zegler's cryptic six-word response after Snow White movie backlash</span></a>
