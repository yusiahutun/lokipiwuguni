It is also rare because, among the 250 sea scorpion species recovered around the world, only a dozen have come from the same geological period, known as the <a class="euc41pk0 e13op9j60 e1qbu6wp1 css-jgjyn2 ef1hf1w0" href=# data-qa=BaseLink-renderAnchor-StyledAnchor><span data-qa=Component-Text class="css-0 e1qbu6wp0">Ordovician.</span></a><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">The team named the animal Archopterus anjiensis after the Anji biota, a unique deposit of exceptionally preserved sponges and other organisms near Zhejiang province’s Anji county where the fossil was found.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">The researchers were surprised to unearth the small sea scorpion among a large number of fossilised sea sponges, which usually live on the sea floor. This indicated Archopterus anjiensis may have favoured a deeper-water environment than its post-Ordovician relatives, Wang said.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">The animal had a parabolic-shaped head and five pairs of legs, with the front four used for walking as it searched the seabed for food, according to Wang. Two paddle-shaped back legs were used for swimming, she said.</p><h3 type=h3 data-qa=Component-Component class="e14khtrb0 css-17x7qa9 e793b7w1"><a class="link-text css-e0dnmk ef1hf1w0" href=# data-qa=BaseLink-renderAnchor-StyledAnchor><p><span data-qa=DigitalArchiveLink-TitleText class="css-66qo9a eeeqn932">Chinese scientists unearth ancient corgi-sized underwater scorpion</span></p></a></h3><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">The fossil also revealed several pairs of limbs at the bottom of its body, one of which was used to grasp and tear food. The animal’s tail was poorly preserved, but was probably nothing like the tail of a modern scorpion and unable to sting or hunt prey.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">Wang said the creature was very different from another eurypterid found in Xiushan, in the southwestern province of Sichuan, which she studied some years ago with European colleagues.</p><a class="euc41pk0 e13op9j60 e1qbu6wp1 css-jgjyn2 ef1hf1w0" href=# data-qa=BaseLink-renderAnchor-StyledAnchor><span data-qa=Component-Text class="css-0 e1qbu6wp0">Terropterus xiushanensis</span></a> lived about 10 million years later than Archopterus anjiensis, long after the first mass extinction. It was 1 metre (3 feet) long and a much more aggressive predator, with highly specialised limbs that could work together to catch and hold prey, she said.<p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">With more sea scorpion species being unearthed in China, Wang said she hoped to connect the dots and paint a more comprehensive picture of this diverse family of creatures – from distribution and evolutionary history to what it could tell us about the Earth’s environment in which they lived.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tK%2FMqWWcp51ku6bD0miaoaGelny0r8iepZydX5a%2FtbXCpZxoa2JnfnJ%2BkGiroqapYsCmrYysmqiqoJ68r3nFqKqsoZxis6q6w2aaoaGelnqzrdGeZKytoqW%2Fqr%2FEZqqcoZWjwaq%2F06w%3D</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./mark-allen-brecel-riyadh-masters-32290398.html><span>←</span><span>Mark Allen goes AWOL during Luca Brecel match with commentators wondering where he's gone</span></a>
