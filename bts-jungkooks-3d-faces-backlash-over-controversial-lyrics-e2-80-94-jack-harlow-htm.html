<span>Jenniffer Sheldon</span></p><h1>BTS Jungkook's '3D' Faces Backlash Over It's Controversial Lyrics Did Jack Harlow Go Too Far?</h1></header><section class=post-content><p>In the wake of the release of "3D," the much-anticipated collaboration between <a href=# rel=nofollow>BTS's Jungkook</a> and American rapper Jack Harlow, the track has stirred a range of reactions, largely revolving around Harlow's verses.</p><p>As the song begins, Harlow's inclusion of Jungkook's name took many listeners by surprise. Opinions on his delivery diverged, with some finding it impressive while others deemed it peculiar and cringe-inducing.</p><h2>Harlow's Verse on Multiple Partners Raises Concerns</h2><p>One of the verses by Harlow raised concerns among listeners. In it, he discusses the number of women in his life, referring to having multiple partners as "wh*ring."</p><p>While it becomes clear that he is directing the term at himself, some listeners found this objectifying and off-putting, especially given the depiction of multiple women in the music video.</p><p>The most contentious line in Harlow's verse, however, was the phrase "All my ABGs get cute for me." While some listeners were initially puzzled by the acronym "ABG," Asian audiences were familiar with its meaning as "Asian Baby Girl."<br></p><p>Many individuals regarded Harlow's use of "ABG" as problematic and offensive due to its historical connotations, emphasizing the need for sensitivity and understanding its origins.</p><p lang=en dir=ltr>"I had one girl too boring<br>Two girls, that was cool for me<br>Three girls, damn dude's horny<br>Four girls, okay now you wh0ring"</p><p>THIS PART TOOK ME OUT <a href=#>pic.twitter.com/Wrrk8iI7j0</a></p>‚Äî K‚Å∑Í™ú | Golden (@tksovers) <a href=#>September 29, 2023</a><p>Conversely, some defended the term, arguing that it has been reclaimed by some individuals who identify with it positively.</p><p lang=en dir=ltr>Help? üíÄ</p><p>I like the song, but the other guy lines? A big no no for me.

They felt forced and didn't blend well with the rest of the song."</li><li>"I can't believe Jack Harlow ruined a perfectly good BTS Jungkook song with his problematic verses. It's a shame."</li><li>"I was really looking forward to BTS Jungkook's '3D', but Jack Harlow's verses just ruined it for me. I wish they had chosen a different collaborator."</li><li>"Jack Harlow's lyrics on '3D' were inappropriate and offensive. It's disappointing to see him tarnish the song with his problematic content."</li><li>"I'm disappointed in BTS for collaborating with Jack Harlow. His verses on '3D' were cringeworthy and didn't do justice to Jungkook's talent."</li><li>"Jack Harlow's verses on '3D' were unnecessary and took away from the overall quality of the song. It would have been better without him."</li></ul><p>The discomfort generated by both the "ABG" and "dead body" lines led some fans to skip Harlow's verses altogether, opting for an alternate version of "3D."</p><p><strong>READ ALSO: <a href=#>BTS Jungkook Crashes SUGA Concert- Army Goes Wild</a>&nbsp;</strong></p><p>In contrast, Jungkook received praise from ARMYs, with many appreciating his lyrics for emphasizing the importance of consent, even as they expressed reservations about Harlow's contributions.
