Gary is very devoted to me and that calms me down. He’s anxious when he’s away from me,” Fisher <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=externalLink data-ordinal=1>told the Herald-Tribune</a>in 2013.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_5-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">The bulldog would get excited by every glimpse he caught of Fisher on a screen. Back in October, his owner, Fisher’s former assistant Corby McCoin, posted a picture of Gary watching mom in the <i>Star Wars: The Last Jedi </i>trailer. “My mom looks more beautiful than ever,” the caption <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=externalLink data-ordinal=1>read</a>.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_9-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">When Gary finally saw his owner’s final film, he was just as excited to see Fisher once again. On Friday, reporter Veronica Miracle shared a video of Gary in <i>Star Wars </i>gear at a screening of the film. “The late Carrie Fisher’s dog Gary just watched The Last Jedi! He sat on Fisher’s former assistant’s lap during the film. She said his ears perked up every time she was on screen,” she wrote.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_15-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">Fisher wasn’t the only recognizable character that Gary saw on-screen. The pup even has a cameo in the film as a space creature, as he was a fixture when Fisher was on set.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_21-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">While Gary surely misses his mom, according to Fisher's daughter Billie Lourd, he's loving the jet-setting life. "He’s the best, he’s the best," Lourd previously told InStyle. "Tongue is still out and dragging all over floors all over the world."</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7qrrSrbClnV6YvK57zZ6urGeTlr%2BztcRmnaKrmJq%2FbrDOoGSwmaSYtaawjKyrmqpdrK6zv4ylmKysXZ%2BypbU%3D</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./494070-wooga-squad-members-profiles-richest.html><span>←</span><span>Wooga squad members' profiles: Who is the richest in 2024</span></a>
