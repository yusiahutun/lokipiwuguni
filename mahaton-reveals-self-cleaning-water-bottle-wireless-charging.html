After all, they're a device designed to get the hydration you need into your mouth.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>But a company called Mahaton is aiming to change the way we <a class=no-callout href=#>drink water</a> with the introduction of its self-cleaning bottle that provides both a stylish way to carry your drinking water and a promise of cleaner water with innovative wireless charging tech.</p><h2 id=mahaton-bottle-features>Mahaton Bottle Features</h2><p>The bulk of what makes this bottle interesting resides in its lid. It uses mercury-free UV-C LED technology to make your drinking water cleaner. In fact, the company promises that it will remove 99.9-percent of bacteria from water within 90 seconds. You can read more about the science behind the use of UV light for sterilization on the bottle's <a href=#>Kickstarter page</a>, but the company does claim that the UV tech has FDA, CE, and SGS certifications.</p><p>Because the bottle needs power in order to perform its sterilization functions, it does feature wireless charging, which the company promises is a world-first for water bottles. You simply place its charger on the lid and let it do its thing.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>https://www.kickstarter.com/projects/995799020/mahaton-bottle-i-wireless-chargingandwater-purification-in-one</p><p>To control the bottle, the lid is also touch-sensitive. You simply need to tap the top of the bottle to get the cleaning process started. This is another world-first, according to creators of the device.</p><p>The bottle itself can hold and clean 350mL of water, which is 11.8 fl oz. To put that into perspective, a typical plastic water bottle is 500mL or 16.9 fl oz.</p><p>As for materials, the body of the bottle is made from 304 stainless steel and promises to be BPA free. The lid is made with food-grade plastics.</p><h2 id=mahaton-bottle-price-and-availablity>Mahaton Bottle Price and Availablity</h2><p>Mahaton is seeking funding for its bottle on <a href=#>Kickstarter</a>. The project started with a fairly modest goal of $10,000, and it has already exceeded it. Backers who want to preorder a bottle can do so for a minimum pledge of $39 while the early special lasts. From there, the price of the bottle jumps to $49.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>As with all crowdfunding projects, <a href=#>there are certain risks involved with putting down your hard-earned money</a>, so make sure you're aware before you commit.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7rq3KnqysnZ%2Bbe6S7zGirmp9foq6prdOopWaqlauyorjSZqqepJZisK2xwKegp59drK61sdFmmaispKGybsPIq5ylnaOoeqS0wKueoqaXZA%3D%3D</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./jennifer-freeman-and-lil-fizz.html><span>←</span><span>Jennifer Freeman and Lil Fizz</span></a>
