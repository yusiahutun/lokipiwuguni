Truth Or Dare</strong></h3><p>If you are having a game night with your partner, then playing Truth Or Dare is inevitable. It's a game that can be played anytime, anywhere, and can help you heat things up. The rules of this game are simple— your partner will select either ‘Truth or Dare’, and based on their choice, you'll ask them a question, or give them a dare. If they don't give an honest answer, they will have to take a sip of alcohol. Similarly, if they fail to perform the dare, they will have to drink. . You both will take turns asking questions and <a href=# onclick='triggerArticleInterlinkClick("article_interlink_click","25 Best Couples Drinking Games to Play And Have Joyful Moments","1204957","https://www.pinkvilla.com/lifestyle/love-relationships/relationship-advice-these-healthy-relationship-goals-are-essential-every-relationship-508344","articlepage","/lifestyle/relationships/couples-drinking-games-1204957","giving naughty dares","Body_Hyperlink","lifestyle","relationships")'>giving naughty dares</a>, and who knows the game might lead to some kissing, hugging, or maybe even more.</p><h3><strong>3.

If not, you take the shots.</p><h3><strong>4. Flip the Coin</strong></h3><p>You don't have any board games or cards to have fun with your partner?

Take a coin and flip it in turns. Your partner needs to guess whether it is heads or tails.

You can notch it up by making it a strip game — if they guess wrong the third time, they have to take off a piece of clothing. Play it as much as you want, or until you are left wearing nothing.
