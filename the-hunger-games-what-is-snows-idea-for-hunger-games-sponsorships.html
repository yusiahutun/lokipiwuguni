After experiencing the growing popularity of Lucy Gray Baird, the female tribute from District 12, and witnessing the interest of Capitol citizens in viewing the tributes, Snow comes up with a plan to introduce a betting and sponsorship program. He suggests that Capitol citizens should be able to support their favorite tributes through sponsorships, which would include providing them with essential resources, such as food, medicine, or even weapons.Snow pitches this idea to the Head Game Maker, Volumnia Gaul, who is intrigued by the concept. She sees the potential for increased excitement and engagement from the viewers, as well as the opportunity for additional revenue through sponsorships. Gaul recognizes Snow's ability to think strategically and manipulatively, and she decides to give his idea a chance.However, suspicions arise when Gaul receives Snow's proposal, suspecting that he might be the sole contributor to the idea. To test his involvement, Gaul drops Snow's essay into a tank of genetically modified snakes and waits to see if they react to his scent. Snow retrieves the pages from the tank, but it is his classmate, Clemensia, who is bitten when she touches the snakes. Snow realizes that the snakes may have identified his scent on the pages, and he must take caution to avoid being exposed.Despite this setback, Snow continues to work with Lucy Gray, using her talents as a singer to captivate the Capitol audience and gain popularity. The attention they generate is temporarily overshadowed by a bombing incident during the tour of the arena, where several tributes and mentors are killed. However, Lucy Gray decides to stay and help an injured Snow instead of escaping.As the Hunger Games commence, most tributes quickly succumb to starvation, sickness, and weakness. Snow and Lucy Gray understand the importance of alliances and strategic moves to survive. Snow's true test comes when he encounters Sejanus Plinth, a fellow tribute and a District sympathizer. Snow convinces Sejanus to leave the arena, acknowledging that he has a stronger chance of making an impact alive than through rebellion within the games.Snow's idea for sponsorships becomes crucial as the games progress. It provides a lifeline for tributes who gain popular support from Capitol citizens, enabling them to access vital resources. This system also allows Snow to manipulate the games further, as he gains favor with influential sponsors and leverages their support for his own benefit.In the end, Lucy Gray emerges as the winner of the Hunger Games. However, Snow's involvement in providing her with food and taming the genetically modified snakes is discovered by the Game Makers. Snow is forced to become a Peacekeeper in District 12, far from the retribution he had hoped for. Despite this setback, Snow continues to plan and strategize, eventually rising to become the infamous President Snow depicted in the original Hunger Games series.Snow's idea for sponsorships in the Hunger Games demonstrates his cunning and understanding of the power dynamics at play in Panem. By introducing sponsorships, he not only gains control over the tributes but also creates a sense of entertainment and engagement among Capitol citizens. This innovative concept serves as a precursor to the extravagant and often manipulative sponsorship system seen in the subsequent Hunger Games events.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tLvCq5itoZNiuqbAx6ibZ5ufonyjrculmJ1ln5t6tLvNoJmiqpSoeqK6w2aqp5mbmsBwwMeeZKGtnpyys3nGmqSeq12staLAjKKqZquepMS0ecidnJpllqS%2FbrTUp56eql2crq6x0maqqaeeqLyzv8eip6w%3D</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./prince-william-balding-head-joke.html><span>←</span><span>Prince William jokes about his lack of hair at royal event</span></a>
