It's a perfect choice for those who desire a hairstyle with shape and body that’s not overly elaborate or time-consuming to style.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_7-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">To navigate trying a butterfly bob, we reached out to the pros to break it all down. Together, they shared with us everything you need to know before you embrace the fun and flirtatious butterfly bob.<br></p><h3 class=mntl-sc-block-universal-callout__heading>Meet the expert</h3><ul><li><a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=externalLink data-ordinal=1>Lacy Redway</a> is a celebrity hairstylist with clients including Tessa Thompson and Hunter Schaefer.</li><li><a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=externalLink data-ordinal=2 rel=nofollow>Johnny Wright</a> is a textured hair specialist and OurX expert hairstylist.</li></ul><span class=heading-toc id=toc-what-is-the-butterfly-bob-haircut></span><h2 id=mntl-sc-block_10-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block instyle-sc-block-heading mntl-sc-block-heading"><span class=mntl-sc-block-heading__text>What Is the Butterfly Bob Haircut?</span></h2><p id=mntl-sc-block_11-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">"The butterfly bob is a less structured version of a traditional bob," says Wright. This playful and romantic style features heavy layers with shorter pieces that frame the face. The name "butterfly" bob comes from the shorter layers at the front of the hair, which resemble butterfly wings."</p><span class=heading-toc id=toc-does-the-butterfly-bob-suit-any-face-shape></span><h2 id=mntl-sc-block_13-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block instyle-sc-block-heading mntl-sc-block-heading"><span class=mntl-sc-block-heading__text>Does the Butterfly Bob Suit Any Face Shape?</span></h2><p id=mntl-sc-block_14-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">When it comes to choosing a new hairstyle, the task of determining whether it will complement your face shape can be quite challenging. According to Redway, the butterfly bob has the unique ability to adapt to any face shape if you simply adjust the face-framing pieces. Adding to this, Wright explains that with a butterfly bob, you have the freedom to create layers that perfectly align with your specific face shape. “For a more <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=internalLink data-ordinal=1>oval face shape</a>, the layers flow or sweep away from the face which is very flattering,” he says. “Individuals with round or square faces can also rock the butterfly bob because it frames the face and creates an illusion of a longer shape.”</p><figure id=mntl-sc-block_16-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block instyle-sc-block-image mntl-sc-block-universal-image mntl-sc-block-image--no-theme no-theme mntl-sc-block-image figure-landscape figure-high-res"><span class=figure-article-caption-owner><p>Getty Images</p></span></figure><span class=heading-toc id=toc-can-the-butterfly-bob-work-on-any-hair-texture></span><h2 id=mntl-sc-block_17-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block instyle-sc-block-heading mntl-sc-block-heading"><span class=mntl-sc-block-heading__text>Can the Butterfly Bob Work on Any Hair Texture?</span></h2><p id=mntl-sc-block_18-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"><br>“The cut of this hairstyle has flow, which makes it easier for wavy or textured hair to have an effortless shape that is accentuated with minimal time styling,” says Wright. “If you have thick and coarse hair, find a stylist that has done this style before and incorporates texturizing techniques into their cuts.” The <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=internalLink data-ordinal=1>curtain bang</a> effect can be more challenging on tight curls and coils.<strong> </strong>“For those with finer, thinner, straight, or unruly hair, you may have to incorporate hot tools in order to maintain this style,” says Wright.<br></p><span class=heading-toc id=toc-how-to-style-the-butterfly-bob></span><h2 id=mntl-sc-block_22-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block instyle-sc-block-heading mntl-sc-block-heading"><span class=mntl-sc-block-heading__text>How to Style the Butterfly Bob</span></h2><p id=mntl-sc-block_23-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">There are many ways to style a butterfly bob. One way is to create a simple, elegant look by blow-drying the hair with a round brush and using a lightweight product to create a smooth, sleek finish. Another way is to create a more voluminous look by blow-drying the hair with a diffuser and using a product that adds volume to the hair. &nbsp;“I love a version that is slightly wavy and a little tousled, almost like rockstar hair,” says Ledway. “I also love a glamorous blown-out version, with big and bouncy curls.”</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_25-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">To create a sleek blown out butterfly bob, Wright recommends following the steps below.</p><h3 id=mntl-sc-block_27-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block instyle-sc-block-subheading mntl-sc-block-subheading"><span class=mntl-sc-block-subheading__text>Step 1</span></h3><p id=mntl-sc-block_28-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">Start with<strong> </strong>clean, dry hair. Then apply a leave-in conditioner. “A good leave-in conditioner/detangler will keep your hair smooth and manageable. I recommend the <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=externalLink data-ordinal=1 rel=nofollow>Ourx Treatment Leave In</a> for lightweight hydration that doesn't weigh the hair down while rocking this style,” says Wright.</p><h3 id=mntl-sc-block_30-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block instyle-sc-block-subheading mntl-sc-block-subheading"><span class=mntl-sc-block-subheading__text>Step 2</span></h3><p id=mntl-sc-block_31-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">Once hair is prepped, separate your hair into four sections—two in the front and two in the back. Use hair clips or bands to keep the sections separate.</p><h3 id=mntl-sc-block_33-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block instyle-sc-block-subheading mntl-sc-block-subheading"><span class=mntl-sc-block-subheading__text>Step 3</span></h3><p id=mntl-sc-block_34-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">Begin styling the back sections. “Remember to use a heat protectant before using any heat styling tools; it will help protect your hair and maintain your style,” says the stylist. Take one of the back sections of hair and comb it thoroughly to remove any tangles. Then, grab a small section of hair from the bottom and use a curling iron to create loose curls. Repeat this step until all the hair in the back section is curled.</p><h3 id=mntl-sc-block_36-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block instyle-sc-block-subheading mntl-sc-block-subheading"><span class=mntl-sc-block-subheading__text>Step 4</span></h3><p id=mntl-sc-block_37-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">Move on to the front sections. Take one of the front sections of hair and comb it out. Use a straightener to create sleek, straight hair with a slight bend at the end. Repeat this step for the other front section of hair.</p><h3 id=mntl-sc-block_39-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block instyle-sc-block-subheading mntl-sc-block-subheading"><span class=mntl-sc-block-subheading__text>Step 5</span></h3><p id=mntl-sc-block_40-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">Once all sections of your hair have been styled, carefully remove the clips or bands and let the hair fall into place. Use a brush or comb to blend the curls and straightened sections together for a seamless look. Use a flat iron to smooth out any unwanted frizz or flyaways.&nbsp;</p><h3 id=mntl-sc-block_42-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block instyle-sc-block-subheading mntl-sc-block-subheading"><span class=mntl-sc-block-subheading__text>Step 6</span></h3><p id=mntl-sc-block_43-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">Add some finishing touches. To enhance the butterfly shape, you can use bobby pins or hair accessories to pin back the sides of your hair, creating a slight "V" shape at the back, then apply a product that adds a light shine.</p><figure id=mntl-sc-block_45-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block instyle-sc-block-image mntl-sc-block-universal-image mntl-sc-block-image--no-theme no-theme mntl-sc-block-image figure-portrait figure-high-res"><span class=figure-article-caption-owner><p>Getty Images</p></span></figure><span class=heading-toc id=toc-how-to-maintain-a-butterfly-bob></span><h2 id=mntl-sc-block_46-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block instyle-sc-block-heading mntl-sc-block-heading"><span class=mntl-sc-block-heading__text>How to Maintain a Butterfly Bob</span></h2><p id=mntl-sc-block_47-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">First and foremost, to prevent any potential harm to your locks, it's crucial to minimize heat use. “Refrain from excessive heat styling and always apply a protective product,” says Wright.&nbsp;Additionally, ensure that you maintain the shape of your haircut. "This particular style demands regular maintenance to style the numerous layers on a daily basis properly," he emphasizes.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_49-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">In order to keep the bob looking its best, Redway suggests allocating a portion of your budget to visit a stylist for shaping regularly. "In addition to maintaining the cut, it is equally important to maintain the health and moisture levels of your hair by utilizing products that are suitable for your specific hair type," she adds.<br></p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7qrrSrbClnV6YvK57wa6rrZ2im7m6ecGomWagkZ6%2FpMHTZm5vbGRmgnI%3D</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./taylor-swift-wonderland-magazine-photos.html><span>←</span><span>Taylor Swift Looks Like A Different Person On The Cover of Wonderland Magazine</span></a>
