He joined the group of athletes managed by Templeton. Some of the runners in this group included Kimutai, Augustine Choge, and Bernard Lagat.</p><p class=align-left>He started his career as a 400m runner as he wanted to step in the shoes of his father and emulate him. However, his coach encouraged him to switch to 800m. The following year he clocked 1.49.6 in a two-lap event when running on a dirty track. This was an amazing performance for a 15-year-old running on a dirt track.</p><a class=c-article-read-also__image-wrapper href=#><img sizes=256px style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/netstorage-tuko.akamaized.net/images/dc460b6fc9f506a5.png></a><a class=c-article-read-also__headline href=# readability=31><p class=c-article-read-also__caption>Read also</p><p class=c-article-read-also__headline-wrapper><span class=c-article-read-also__headline-hover-inner>Emmanuel Korir bio: family, training, olympics, net worth, career</span></p></a><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/netstorage-tuko.akamaized.net/images/9125943711f69871.jpg><p class=align-left>In 2006, he became the world junior champion in the 800 m category.
