Robyn revealed Juan’s alleged infidelity in an episode of her and Real Housewives of Potomac co-star Gizelle Bryant’s podcast, “Reasonably Shady,” in January 2023. “Juan was an idiot and communicated with this woman on Instagram because, you know, whatever he’s bored. He needs attention. It’s the pandemic. Blah, blah, blah,” Robyn said at the time, adding that the alleged infidelity with the woman, who is from Canada, during the COVID-19 pandemic before filming started on The Real Housewives of Potomac Season 7. “They did not date. He did not fly her anywhere.”</p><p>Robyn revealed that the woman Juan allegedly cheated on her with had a hotel receipt with his name on it. She explained, however, that there was a reason Juan’s name was on the receipt, claiming that the woman messaged Juan about losing her wallet and asked if he could pay for the hotel. She alleged that Juan put his credit card down and left the hotel. “The situation when it was presented to me was handled. [It] was discussed… It was something we had to work through, you know? It was not something that it was just, ‘Oh, okay, whatever,'” Robyn said. “Maybe that’s why the wedding didn’t happen when yall wanted it to.”</p><p>Robyn also revealed on the podcast that she had been “waiting” for one of her Real Housewives of Potomac co-stars “to bring” up the affair and was surprised when cast mate Karen Huger brought up a different rumor instead. “When we’re in Mexico, Ashley [Darby] tells me that Karen is talking about us, and I’m like ‘Oh, okay this is it,'” she said. “And she talks about him holding hands with a blonde in Georgetown and I’m like, ‘This is ridiculous.’ So that was kind of comical to me.”</p><p>So who did Juan allegedly cheat on Robyn with from The Real Housewives of Potomac? In an interview with the YouTube channel Georgio Says in February, the woman, who only <a rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow" href=#>went by her first name “Brittany</a>,” confirmed that she direct messaged Juan first, but their communication was serious enough that they were “both just waiting for the [COVID] restrictions be lifted” so they could meet in person. She claimed that, “at least a year” into talking, Brittany traveled from Canada to Maryland, where she planned to “meet [Juan] at the hotel and just get settled in.]</p><p>Brittany also denied Robyn’s claim on Watch What Happens Live that Brittany came to Maryland because “she was dating a Baltimore Ravens player,” not to see Juan. “I have no idea where that story came from—it’s very confusing,” Brittany said. “I have no reason to go to Maryland other than to see Juan.”</p><p>Brittany also addressed Robyn’s allegation that Juan’s name was on her hotel receipt because she lost her wallet, calling the story “outrageous.” “[It] just doesn’t make sense,” she said, adding that she believes Juan “gave [Robyn] the story that she has regurgitated to [viewers].”</p><p>She continued, “It was very clear that the relationship was for TV. Like, it was for the fans. It was a paycheck, and that was just their obligation. They needed to do what they needed to do pretty much for TV, and he made it clear that he does have that respect for Robyn, but it was not a real relationship.”</p><p>Brittany also denied Robyn’s claim that Brittany asked her for $4,000 in hush money via Zelle to not go public with the allegations. “It’s a little outrageous and I wish she would’ve put more thought into her statement because I am in Canada…We don’t have Zelle. We don’t accept Zelle, I can’t request Zelle. I don’t have access to that on my phone,” she said.</p><p>In screenshots shared by several Bravo fan accounts on Twitter, the <a rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow" href=#>woman’s full name is “Brittany Murray</a>” and she emailed Robyn from an account named britt.money@hotmail.com.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmirpK65pq%2FArKueql6YvK57y6KqratfrLWwecmumKdlk52yosCMsKCtoF2nvKPFzWapnpmcYrWwwdKerqKulah6sLKMqaatp52WsHA%3D</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./china-standards-2035-how-china-plans-win-future-its-own.html><span>←</span><span>Opinion | China Standards 2035: How China plans to win the future with its own international tech st</span></a>
