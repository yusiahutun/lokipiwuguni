Terms were not disclosed but reports last week said the one-year deal to back up starter Anthony Richardson was worth up to $8.1 million. The 2013 Super Bowl MVP while with the champion Baltimore Ravens, Flacco was out of the league last season until the Browns, amid a rash of injuries to their quarterbacks, signed him to the practice squad on Nov. 20. Flacco, 38, ended the season as Cleveland's starter, and the Browns won four of his five regular-season starts, the last four in succession. He threw for 1,616 yards and 13 touchdowns with eight interceptions in those five games and completed just over 60 percent of his pass attempts. The Browns, the runners-up in the AFC North, lost 45-14 to the Houston Texans in the wild-card round of the playoffs. Flacco threw for 307 yards and a touchdown, but he was intercepted twice. The Colts (9-8) missed the postseason for the third straight season, finishing one game behind the Texans in the AFC South. In 16 NFL seasons, Flacco has thrown for 43,936 yards, 18th on the all-time list, and 245 touchdowns, with 155 interceptions. --Field Level Media</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7rbHAnZyrZZOWua16wqikaKugpL%2B1v46nmK2hn6OurXvCqKOtq12otqi6jK%2BcrZ2ilrtuvcFmoaidXZu5oq%2FCqGaaqqSesK2xvpprcWlnaLF3eZFscGxlZZp%2Bc3nBbZhvZZVtrnevxXFrapxll3upwMyl</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./chris-stapleton-since-1978-country-music-hall-of-fame-exhibit-pictures.html><span>←</span><span>Chris Stapleton's Career Spotlighted in New Hall of Fame Exhibit</span></a>
