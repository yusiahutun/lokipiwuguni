Furniture and other items were thrown onto the street, while a bunk bed dangled precariously from the edge.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">Twenty-two residents were evacuated, including six Polytechnic University students and the seven-year tenant of the affected flat. Chan Wing-yam, 65, was sleeping on a bunk bed at the time.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">“Everything was fine all these years … There were no signs that the building was unsafe,” said the retiree, who rented one of the five subdivided rooms for HK$3,000 a month, sharing the kitchen and toilet with four other occupants.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">Buildings Department senior building surveyor Ronnie Wong Kwok-ping said the collapse could have been the result of rain, rusting of concrete-reinforcing steel bars and a general lack of repair over the years, but the block itself was not in any immediate danger of collapse.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">“We believe the danger is limited to a specific area only, which includes the balcony and part of the walls on the floor above that have been pulled down,” Wong said. The department is investigating the cause of the collapse.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">The building is one of dozens in the area acquired by Henderson Land for redevelopment projects.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">The residents were relocated to a community centre temporarily as department officials checked the building’s structural safety.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">Developer Richfield Realty, a company closely linked to Henderson and claiming to represent it, said the incident was “unfortunate”. It said it was trying to arrange rehousing for residents in its empty flats nearby.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">The damaged balcony was removed on Wednesday afternoon. The department said those on the third and fourth floors – also found to be structurally unsafe – will be propped up with steel girders.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">According to records, the owners were issued with at least two works orders, including one in 2009 declaring the building to be dangerous and ordering them to remove “loose, cracked and otherwise defective” concrete, “clean exposed steel bars of loose rust and foreign matters” and fix additional ones if necessary.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">The owners failed to comply and the department had to carry out the works and recover costs from them. The work was completed in 2011.</p><figure data-qa=Component-StyledFigure class="css-1yuz473 exv1azg4">If you add the extra loading of windows, concrete, subdivisions and furniture, it becomes a real dangerAndrew Kung Sui-lun, Institute of Surveyors</figure><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">The department received a report about neglect last month. Officials found the building to be safe but issued a warning to the owners to carry out necessary work to prevent further deterioration.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">Andrew Kung Sui-lun of the Institute of Surveyors’ said it had long been common for tenement block owners to close off cantilevered balconies to maximise the internal floor area.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">Such work would require raising the enclosed balcony with a layer of concrete and adding windows and parapets. While such work should be submitted for approval by the department, many were not and the department lacked manpower to ensure citywide compliance, Kung said.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">“Cantilevered balconies are high risk. If you add the extra loading of windows, concrete, subdivisions and furniture, it becomes a real danger,” he said.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">He said ignored problems like cracks in concrete meant rain could seep through and cause steel bars to corrode faster.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">“Penalties should be raised to a level in which landlords feel it is simpler and cheaper to just remove the balcony than risk a fine or worse, causing loss of life.”</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">Additional reporting by Elizabeth Cheung</p><p>This article appeared in the South China Morning Post print edition as: more balconies to be removed after collapse</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tK%2FMqWWcp51ku6bD0mifqKaXYriwusZoo5qvXZi%2FqrnEaJirrJmYuaZ7kWlwcmpnaXytwcKksGado5iusbGMoaynn12dvK55xaWYrWWimsCqsMSnq6xllqG8sL6MnKalpJGlwKa%2FjK6lnZ2i</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./nell-fortner.html><span>←</span><span>Who is Nell Fortner dating?
