On top of this, the wedding florist will include the flowers for the church, plus the bouquet and more.</p><p class=mol-para-with-font>'With the wedding hosted in the Middletons' rustic garden, with wild flower meadows and in-bloom purple rhododendrons, expect tall overflowing centrepieces fusing the marquee with the garden.

From bar hire to amazing dance floors, production is key to transforming the blank-canvas of a marquee into something truly jaw-dropping.'</p><p class=mol-para-with-font><span class="mol-style-large mol-style-bold femail-ccox">GROOMSWEAR £6,050 -</span> 'Dashing groom-to-be James Matthews is likely to be wearing a bespoke tailor made tailcoat, waistcoat and trousers from one of London’s top Saville Row tailors.
