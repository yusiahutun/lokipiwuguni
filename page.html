If your dinner parties are anything like mine, dessert arrives with more of a whimper than a bang. Oh yes, that trifle looks lovely, <a href=#>that cheesecake</a> is most certainly the bomb, most people are probably thinking, but I just crawled out of a vat of <a href=#>deeply braised short ribs</a> and I’m gasping for air.

I’m sure that’s it just coincidence that the coffee kick began just as the number of hours I slept each night decreased, which also coincided with me getting weepy with joy when I wrapped my fingers around my first coffee of the day each morning <i>afternoon</i>. Amazing how you can drink something your whole life but it then all of the sudden one day it becomes a transcendent experience, you know?<p><a class=more-link href=#>Read more <span>»</span></a></p><a class=smittenkitchen-thumbnail href=# rel=bookmark><img width=500 height=332 src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/149401384.v2.pressablecdn.com/wp-content/uploads//2015/05/cream-biscuits1.jpg alt decoding=async style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center><span class=smittenkitchen-primary-category>Recipe</span></a> There are biscuits and there are biscuits. There are biscuits that you serve with chili, with barbecue or alongside some eggs and grits. And there are biscuits that you bring out in a warmed basket with a cloth napkin draped over them at a dinner party, to sop up a braise or slather with honey-butter. These biscuits are of the latter variety but I suspect they will quickly become your one and only biscuit because if you’re anything like me, you’ll wonder where they’ve been your whole life.<p><a class=more-link href=#>Read more <span>»</span></a></p><p>Once again, it is not you but <a href=#>your baking powder sabotaging your awesome kitchen prowess</a>. That slightly bitter, kinda “tinny” flavor you often experience when biting into a muffin, biscuit or scone is the result of using a baking powder in high quantities — as is needed for these quick-rise treats — with aluminum in it. Fortunately, aluminum-free brands such as <a href=#>Rumford</a> or <a href=#>Bob’s Red Mill</a> are easy to find, and are no more expensive. Or, you can just go rogue and <a href=#>make your own</a>.</p><a class=smittenkitchen-thumbnail href=# rel=bookmark><img width=640 height=425 src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/149401384.v2.pressablecdn.com/wp-content/uploads//2014/11/balsamic-braised-brussels-sprouts-with-pancetta1.jpg alt decoding=async style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center><span class=smittenkitchen-primary-category>Recipe</span></a> It seems unfair to compare the two Brussels sprouts dishes I have made in the last couple weeks because they’re so different, about the only thing they have in common is the stand where I bought them. It’s like comparing apples and oranges, boiled lima beans and chocolate cake, the cuteness of my kid versus the cuteness of any other baby on earth… you know? One of the dishes is rich, salty-sweet and fork tender, the other is raw, slightly rubbery, acidic and at least according to a review on Epicurious that I probably should have taken more seriously, “was like eating a bowl of grass”. You’ll never guess which one we liked better.<p><a class=more-link href=#>Read more <span>»</span></a></p><a class=smittenkitchen-thumbnail href=# rel=bookmark><img width=1024 height=680 src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/149401384.v2.pressablecdn.com/wp-content/uploads//2009/11/cappucino-fudge-cheesecake.jpg alt decoding=async style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center><span class=smittenkitchen-primary-category>Recipe</span></a> Given that it is but two days after one of the most indulgent meals of the year, I suspect the last thing you want to hear about is the most indulgent cake I have ever made, and yet, given the quality of the last two vegetable-focused, lighter dishes I have made — both of which I’d give a resounding “eh” — trust me, what I’ve got going on here is much more worthy of your attention, and your table at some distant dinner party. So pull up a chair.<p><a class=more-link href=#>Read more <span>»</span></a></p><a class=smittenkitchen-thumbnail href=# rel=bookmark><img width=3282 height=2188 src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/149401384.v2.pressablecdn.com/wp-content/uploads//2009/11/gingerbread-upside-down-apple-cake.jpg alt decoding=async style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center><span class=smittenkitchen-primary-category>Recipe</span></a> I know everyone says that this whole early-baby thing “goes by so fast” and “blink and you’ll miss it” and I believed them, I really did. But I hadn’t prepared to take a bite of this cake last week and push it away disinterested because it’s “too fall/wintery for right now”, look at the date on my phone and realize that, holy gingerbread (see how baby-friendly we’re getting here at SK?!), it’s freaking November already. And not early November, but days before Thanksgiving, thus, late November. And forget November, what happened in October? I remember nothing, not one single thing save a vague recollection of <a href=#>an overlarge can of Crisco</a>.<p><a class=more-link href=#>Read more <span>»</span></a></p><a class=smittenkitchen-thumbnail href=# rel=bookmark><img width=3892 height=2586 src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/149401384.v2.pressablecdn.com/wp-content/uploads//2009/11/creamed-spinach.jpg alt decoding=async style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center><span class=smittenkitchen-primary-category>Recipe</span></a> I started fixin’ for some creamed spinach when I was pregnant — yes, they aren’t kidding about those iron cravings — but I never got to making it this summer. Because I didn’t have… time. Now, just pause for a second while I reach through this computer to throttle my summer self for thinking she knew what not having time was all about.<p><a class=more-link href=#>Read more <span>»</span></a></p><a class=smittenkitchen-thumbnail href=# rel=bookmark><img width=1024 height=680 src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/149401384.v2.pressablecdn.com/wp-content/uploads//2009/11/sweet-potato-pie.jpg alt decoding=async style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center><span class=smittenkitchen-primary-category>Recipe</span></a> As many of you have figured out, I’ve got a megawatt crush on Southern food. It comes out with a vengeance all summer when I want nothing more than to <a href=#>dry-rub ribs</a>, make <a href=#>corn bread and buttermilk dressing salads</a>, dive headfirst into <a href=#>tomato pie</a> and douse pretty much everything in <a href=#>bourbon</a> then usually goes into a soft hibernation over the winter save a <a href=#>fried chicken</a> or <a href=#>chicken and dumplings</a> run-in or two.<p><a class=more-link href=#>Read more <span>»</span></a></p><a class=smittenkitchen-thumbnail href=# rel=bookmark><img width=3795 height=2521 src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/149401384.v2.pressablecdn.com/wp-content/uploads//2009/11/swiss-chard-and-sweet-potato-gratin.jpg alt decoding=async style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center><span class=smittenkitchen-primary-category>Recipe</span></a> Surely I’m not alone in this: When I’m eating starchy foods, I think I should be eating more greens. When I’m eating my greens, I wish I had heavier foods to balance them. And pretty much all of the time, I wonder why it has been so long since I made <a href=#>macaroni and cheese</a>.<p><a class=more-link href=#>Read more <span>»</span></a></p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmirnZ7BtbHNpKCtm5iau2%2BvzqZmqZmXmnx5go4%3D</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./ag-jeans-friends-and-family-sale-7483741.html><span>←</span><span>This InStyle-Approved Denim Brand Is Having a Sitewide Sale</span></a>
