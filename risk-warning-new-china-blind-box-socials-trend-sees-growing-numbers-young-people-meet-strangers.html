If I were interacting with people I know, I would have to consider their feelings, but with strangers, I don’t need to worry so much. We can gather if we want and leave just as freely.”</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">However, the downside to such gatherings is that they might not turn out the way an individual expected or desired, much like blind box products.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">According to Zhang Xiaoyuan, the former dean of the Journalism Department at Sichuan University in southwestern China, any gathering of complete strangers carries risks.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/cdn.i-scmp.com/sites/default/files/d8/images/canvas/2024/03/09/0fbde9c6-155a-44a8-844a-fc77aaff523e_161c0408.jpg><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">“It is important for organisers and participants to be aware of the risk of being deceived. Engaging in social interactions with strangers might also lead to encounters with fraudsters or malicious individuals,” Zhang said.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">Wang Xueren, an event organiser, recounted an incident where a man initially behaved well, bringing homemade snacks to a gathering. However, after consuming too much alcohol, he started harassing female participants.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">Gaibao said she attends women-only events if she thinks physical contact is unavoidable for the activity.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">The trend has attracted a mixed reaction on mainland social media.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">“I am afraid to make such unknown friends in case I wake up the next day without my money, phone, ID, or even my kidneys,” said one online observer.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">“Young people are cutting ties with relatives back in their hometowns while engaging in such activities with strangers in the city. It’s so odd,” said another.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">However, a third person understood the appeal of the trend and said: “These people are simply tired of socialising with long-time acquaintances and have sought something fresh and thrilling.”</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tK%2FMqWWcp51ku6bD0minnqegobJur9Slq66qlWTBs7HNnaCnn12Ytaq6wGiYq6yZmLmme5JrbG1vZ218s7XSpGSwmaKjtq%2BzjKecsGWTnbavrYybo6KmlGKvsMSMrKacoZGhwG7A0Z6lnWWjmrK0ecarprChnpx6r8HMm5yrq12uvLa6xmannqegobJuucSeq2arpKeur7PEq6o%3D</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./keith-urban-nashville-airport-surprise-show.html><span>←</span><span>Keith Urban Plays a Surprise Mini-Show at the Nashville Airport</span></a>
