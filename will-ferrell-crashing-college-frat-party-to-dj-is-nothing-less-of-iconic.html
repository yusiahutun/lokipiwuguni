Who would have thought?</strong></p><p>The <a href=#>Hollywood</a> star attended to DJ at a Sigma Alpha Mu fraternity tailgate party&nbsp;ahead of their football game against the University of Arizona Wildcats, and what a way to kick off Trojan Family Weekend.

And that’s exactly what they did, as videos of the 56-year-old have now gone viral on the platform.</p><p>The Step Brothers star, who is a UCL college alum himself, can be seen clapping along in a crowd of students to the smash hit, Eye of The Tiger.</p><p>He was certainly dressed for the occasion, blending in with the students with his youthful <a href=#>fashion</a> sense. He rocked the stage with a USC red cap, backward, of course.</p><p>The <a href=#>Barbie</a> actor wore headphones over the top of his hat and a zip-up black jumper, standing out as he was surrounded by a sea of burgundy.</p><p>His eldest son, Magnus is a sophomore at the college, and <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">according</a> to his LinkedIn, is set to graduate in 2026.</p><p>Will also has two more sons with his wife, Viveca Paulin. Mattius, who is 16, and Axel, who is 13. Who knows, they may grow up to be UCL stars too!</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading id=h-fans-go-wild-for-the-dj-set>Fans go wild for the DJ set</h2><p>As well as the crowd in real life, fans online are also going wild for the DJ set, taking to social media to express their excitement, and in some cases, shock. Others also confused him for <a href=#>music</a> star, Chad Smith, and honestly, we see the resemblance.</p><p>“I can’t tell the difference now between Chad Smith and Will Ferrell anymore,” joked one.</p><p>Another penned: “Was this real or for a movie? Either way it’s awesome but even more awesome if it’s real.”</p><p>“What a legendary video!!!” exclaimed another.</p><p>“This is magical,” another penned.</p><p>Related Topics</p><p>MORE CELEBRITY STORIES</p><span></span><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7pLHLnpmroaSuwaqwwaKrZ5ufonxzfJFsZmpoX2WGcMPIpaNmnpWnv6a4y2aaq5mjnbavs4ycpqWklZyybrLRmqtmqJGnwbp506hknaJdnsBuus6tn6Kml2K5pr%2FSZqafZZmYvK%2B1wmg%3D</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./pitchfork-launching-weekly-magazine-as-mobile-app.html><span>←</span><span>Pitchfork Launching Weekly Magazine As Mobile App</span></a>
