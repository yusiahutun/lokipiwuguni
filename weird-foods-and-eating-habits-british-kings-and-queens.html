He always ate with 30 of his courtiers each day, with breakfast at around 10am.</p><h3 type=h3 data-qa=Component-Component class="e14khtrb0 css-17x7qa9 e793b7w1"><a class="link-text css-e0dnmk ef1hf1w0" href=# data-qa=BaseLink-renderAnchor-StyledAnchor><span data-qa=DigitalArchiveLink-Topic class="css-1wyvcgo e1b1x8aa3"></span><p><span data-qa=DigitalArchiveLink-Title class="css-i31uou e1b1x8aa1">What 7 things will Queen Elizabeth never eat or drink?</span></p></a></h3><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">Spit-roasted meats were central to the daily diet with pork or mutton eaten on a normal day with peacocks, herons, egrets, deer and swans served up on special occasions. Banquets were 14-course show stoppers with peacock often the star. After roasting, it was presented on the table with its blue feathers and gold gilded beak in place. There was also cockentrice and other strange delicacies.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/cdn.i-scmp.com/sites/default/files/d8/images/methode/2020/04/07/66960d0a-733c-11ea-ab8f-988daf8efd6f_972x_184051.jpg><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">1. Cockentrice – Henry VIII first served up cockentrice, a “mythical beast” featuring a pig and capon sewn together, in a bid to impress the King of France.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">2. Boar’s head was usually garnished with bay leaves and rosemary and was a popular table centrepiece at Christmas.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">3. Roasted swan – Swan was considered a noble bird during King Henry’s reign. It was usually presented on the table with a crown on its head.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">4. Vegetables – Henry was not a fan and he considered them peasant food. But they were always on the banquet table, usually cabbage, broad beans, peas, leeks and onions.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">5. Marzipan – as sugar was a scarce commodity at that time, sweet treats were not an everyday thing. This almond, sugar dessert was flavoured with cinnamon and pepper.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/cdn.i-scmp.com/sites/default/files/d8/images/methode/2020/04/07/b9cf88f6-733d-11ea-ab8f-988daf8efd6f_972x_184051.jpg><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">Everyday favourite dishes on the royal table would raise a few eyebrows today.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">1. Grilled beaver’s tails – usually served on Fridays, the day when only fish was supposed to be consumed. Conveniently, medieval people classified beaver as a fish back then.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">2. Whale and porpoise were favourites of Henry’s first wife, Catherine of Aragon, and were served on Fridays as well. They were cheap and one could feed a lot of people. They were either boiled or roasted.</p><h3 type=h3 data-qa=Component-Component class="e14khtrb0 css-17x7qa9 e793b7w1"><a class="link-text css-e0dnmk ef1hf1w0" href=# data-qa=BaseLink-renderAnchor-StyledAnchor><span data-qa=DigitalArchiveLink-Topic class="css-1wyvcgo e1b1x8aa3"></span><p><span data-qa=DigitalArchiveLink-Title class="css-i31uou e1b1x8aa1">What do Prince Harry, Meghan and other British royals most love to eat?</span></p></a></h3><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">3. Internal organs – nose to tail is not a new concept as medieval cooks did not like wasting any part of the animals either. Beef lungs, spleen and udders preserved in brine or vinegar were regarded as delicacies.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">4. Eel, cod, herring, crab, trout, salmon, and every other aquatic beast – there was nothing Henry would not eat.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">Vast quantities of beer and wine were served with every meal. Historians estimate that 600,000 gallons of ale (enough to fill an Olympic-size swimming pool) and 75,000 gallons of wine (enough to fill 1,500 bathtubs) were consumed annually at Hampton Court.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31"><strong data-qa=ContentSchemaRender-defaultRenderMapFunctions-Component-0 class="css-1mniedq eq9i94316">Elizabeth I (reigned from 1558-1603)</strong></p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/cdn.i-scmp.com/sites/default/files/d8/images/methode/2020/04/07/2042d504-733c-11ea-ab8f-988daf8efd6f_972x_184051.jpg><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">By the end of the Tudor era, banquets had become more lavish and creative. With the explorers returning from the New World with exotic edibles, Elizabethan banquets birthed what is now known as the turducken. Turkeys were brought to England and became popular Christmas fare but not like we have today. The Tudor Christmas Pie featured a rectangular pie crust that enveloped a turkey stuffed with partridge stuffed with pigeon. The three-bird roasts lived on until the 19th century when the pies were served cold.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/cdn.i-scmp.com/sites/default/files/d8/images/methode/2020/04/07/f6b11854-733b-11ea-ab8f-988daf8efd6f_972x_184051.jpg><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">Soon after her father Henry VIII died, a tally was made of Elizabeth I’s annual household provisions. It featured 1,240 oxen, 8,200 sheep, 2,330 deer, 760 calves, 1,870 pigs and 53 wild boars – that’s a lot of sheep and deer.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31"><strong data-qa=ContentSchemaRender-defaultRenderMapFunctions-Component-0 class="css-1mniedq eq9i94316">Queen Victoria (reigned from 1837-1901)</strong></p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/cdn.i-scmp.com/sites/default/files/d8/images/methode/2020/04/07/8207c8b8-733b-11ea-ab8f-988daf8efd6f_972x_184051.jpg><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">Known as the greedy queen, Victoria loved her food. And diet. What diet? She loved meat as much as dessert. She could easily have inspired the idea of the buffet as she loved to have a lot of choices for breakfast. The palace chef would prepare a mainly protein heavy breakfast such as eggs on toast, smoked haddock, fish, porridge and she loved lamb chops.</p><h3 type=h3 data-qa=Component-Component class="e14khtrb0 css-17x7qa9 e793b7w1"><a class="link-text css-e0dnmk ef1hf1w0" href=# data-qa=BaseLink-renderAnchor-StyledAnchor><span data-qa=DigitalArchiveLink-Topic class="css-1wyvcgo e1b1x8aa3"></span><p><span data-qa=DigitalArchiveLink-Title class="css-i31uou e1b1x8aa1">What’s the story behind instant ramen noodles?</span></p></a></h3><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">For dinner, the royal menu always started with soup and featured several courses. Queen Victoria’s favourite soup was a hard-to-make pale consomme with clarified veal stock and egg shells. Next was a fish dish, she loved turbot and whitebait, then a meat dish, she loved roast beef, then always a dessert. There was always a buffet table, too, with meat such as venison, brawn, marrowbones and more beef.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/cdn.i-scmp.com/sites/default/files/d8/images/methode/2020/04/07/6706b2de-7342-11ea-ab8f-988daf8efd6f_972x_184051.JPG><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">Her food choices might seem tame compared to those of her ancestors, but it was unusual for women to eat so much back then. These were the days when noble women would deprive themselves of food to stay slim and even swallow tapeworms to stay dangerously thin.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">When Victoria was young, she was only allowed to eat plain food and historians say that sometimes her dinner comprised only bread and milk. She vowed to eat richer food when she was older. And she kept that promise.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/cdn.i-scmp.com/sites/default/files/d8/images/methode/2020/04/07/f0e6acea-7340-11ea-ab8f-988daf8efd6f_972x_184051.jpg><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">Victoria was a fast eater, and those dining with her were only allowed to eat when she ate, and had to stop when she stopped. That couldn’t have been much fun for slow eaters. She was said to be extremely rude when hungry, and hardly spoke during meal times. She also never liked a pause between courses – she liked those dishes to keep on coming. She had a notorious sweet tooth and was partial to cranberry pie with cream. She could also knock back a few drinks, especially Scotch whisky, which she loved with soda water.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">She was an adventurous eater, and would try new things like bird’s nest soup, ostrich egg omelette and as Empress of India, she loved a good curry.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">Want more stories like this?
