The country veteran has found a buyer for the small, but luxurious home, which is listed for $3.5 million&nbsp;— more than 10 times the amount she originally paid.</p><p>The "Maybe It Was Memphis" singer first <a href=#>purchased</a> the bare 70-acre property in 2012 for $301,239.

An enclosed porch sits just off the common area, with an abundance of natural light and plenty of views of the property.</p><p>Rustic wood floors that appear to be made of old barn wood cover the floors of the house, making for the perfect combination of old and new design. Keeping with that theme, the upstairs bedroom features a weathered door and a vintage rotary wall phone.</p><p>Nestled in Williamson County outside of Nashville, the cabin sits on the banks of Younger Creek. The property features plenty of serenity along the creek bank and wooded areas. In addition to the cabin Tillis built, there is a barn and storage unit on the land.</p><p>The home is currently under contingency, and it's unclear whether the property will sell at full asking price. Tillis has yet to comment on the sale.</p><h2 class=photogallery-title>PICTURES: See Inside Pam Tillis' Spectacular $3.5 Million Tennessee Cabin</h2><p>Pam Tillis has just sold her deluxe Tennessee cabin, and she stands to make a pretty penny from the spectacular property.</p><p class=photogallery-credit>Gallery Credit: <a href=#>Jess</a></p><h2 class=photogallery-title>PICTURES: See Inside Thomas Rhett's $4.7 Million Rural Paradise</h2>When&nbsp;<a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Thomas Rhett</a>&nbsp;and his wife,&nbsp;<a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Lauren Akins</a>, want to get away from it all, they sure have plenty of space and privacy.
