Although many box office hits are listed as a testament to his incredible talent, there is one that cemented his career. Despite the effect and cult following Taxi Driver has, it’s a touchy subject for Robert De Niro.</strong></p><p>The <a href=#>Hollywood</a> star, born in New York City, had a somewhat normal upbringing growing up. His parents split when he was a toddler after his father, Robert De Niro Snr, came out as gay. Little Robert grew up with the street kids, who many became lifelong pals, but found a passion for the arts while still in school. He loved the cinema, and it would be 10 years since his first minor debut that he caught attention for his incredible performance in one of Martin Scorsese’s psychological dramas. Although fans still can’t stop quoting Taxi Driver 50 years later, Robert De Niro refuses to talk about the <a href=#>movie</a>, apparently.</p><figure class="wp-block-grvmedia-grv-video GRVMultiVideo"></figure><h2 class=wp-block-heading id=h-robert-de-niro-s-complicated-relationship-with-taxi-driver>Robert De Niro’s complicated relationship with Taxi Driver</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/cdn1.celebritytidbit.com/uploads/39/2023/08/GettyImages-75453100-1024x668.jpg><p>Before being cast in the “landmark performance”, he was already known in Hollywood. De Niro had portrayed a young Vito Corleone in The Godfather Part II in 1974. He was alongside Al Pacino – who is still his <a href=#>celebrity</a> friend – and Marlon Brando.</p><p>The second installment of the much-loved mafia story won six Oscars, with De Niro himself taking home Best Supporting Actor at the <a href=#>awards show</a>. It would be his first Academy win, and interestingly, he and Brando are the first pair of stars to win an Academy Award for playing the same character.</p><p>Fast-forward another couple of years, and Robert De Niro is back with the iconic director Scorsese for Taxi Driver. The duo had worked together for Mean Streets, and the young star was brought in for this drama.</p><p>The Manhattan native took the part seriously, spending time with US veterans to learn their mannerisms and Midwestern accent. He also shed 30 pounds, studied taxi drivers behaviors and underwent firearm training.</p><p>Robert De Niro’s famous quote, “You talkin’ to me?” – which he completely improvised, by the way – has been a classic throwaway line. It’s been referenced time and time again, and will surely go down in cinema history.</p><p>But it wasn’t the time on set, the screenplay or even the critic reviews of the film that got to De Niro. It was a tragic event that came after.</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading id=h-he-gets-extremely-upset>“He gets extremely upset”</h2><figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-rich is-provider-twitter wp-block-embed-twitter"><p lang=en dir=ltr>Taxi Driver&nbsp;[1976]</p><p>Robert De Niro prepared for the role by working as a late night cab driver in New York City early 1975. One of his fares was a struggling actor who recognized him. He said to De Niro discouragingly "You just won an Oscar. My God, is it THAT hard to get work?" <a href=#>pic.twitter.com/AeC0eyy71d</a></p>— Films and Stuffs (@filmsandstuffs) <a href=#>July 4, 2020</a></figure><p>View Tweet</p><p>His friend, the director Ulu Grosbard, told Vanity Fair in 1987 that Taxi Driver was off-limits in conversation with Robert De Niro.</p><p>He explained: “Do not ever bring up the subject of Taxi Driver with Robert. He gets extremely upset.”</p><p>The reason behind it stems from an assassination attempt on the president. John Hinkley Jr, attempted to kill President Ronald Reagan on March 30, 1981. This was the same night of the Academy Awards that year. It was also two months after Reagan’s first inauguration.</p><p>However, in the time leading up to the plot, he became obsessed with Robert De Niro’s film Taxi Driver. The movie features a similar plot, with character Travis planning to do the same to a presidential candidate. Hinkley also became infatuated with Jodie Foster, who was cast in the film as a vulnerable 12-year-old. His feelings grew scarily, with him sending her letters, poems and leaving her messages.</p><p>Suffering with mental <a href=#>health</a>, his life didn’t improve. He began to target Reagan after failing to harm the former president Jimmy Carter.</p><p>On that fateful night, Hinkley shot at the president as he was leaving Washington DC’s Hilton Hotel. Luckily, the bullet ricocheted off the limousine before hitting him in the chest. However, a police officer and Secret Service agent were wounded, as well as a press secretary. The president survived the attempt.</p><p>During the trial, one doctor diagnosed him with three types of personality disorders but rendered him legally sane to stand. However, the jurors brought back a verdict of Hinkley being found not guilty by reason of insanity. He was sent to St Elizabeth’s Hospital in 1982, and released from institutional care in 2016.</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading id=h-the-oscars-were-postponed>The Oscars were postponed</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/cdn1.celebritytidbit.com/uploads/39/2023/08/GettyImages-1202357729-1024x694.jpg><p>As the president’s assassination attempt happened on the same day the Academy Awards were set to air, they were <a href=# rel=nofollow>halted</a> until the following evening.</p><p>In 1981, Scorsese and Robert De Niro weren’t waiting on any Oscars for Taxi Driver, it was actually their other film, Raging Bull. But due to the Taxi Driver obsessed would-be assassin causing a stir with Hollywood gossip, Robert De Niro and the director wanted to avoid any conversation on the event.</p><p>The following night, on April 1, 1981, De Niro did scoop a gong for his part in the movie. Although, the Red Carpet and press only wanted to talk to him about the assassination, Grunge <a href=# rel=nofollow>reports</a>.</p><p>Shawn Levy, who penned the biography, De Niro: A Life, said Robert was nice about the Taxi Driver questions and refused to talk about it.</p><p>Levy quoted the star staying: “I don’t want to discuss the matter now. Look, I said what I wanted to say [at the Oscars]. You’re all very nice, but that’s it.”</p><p>Related Topics</p><p>MORE CELEBRITY STORIES</p><span></span><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7pLHLnpmroaSuwaqwwaKrZ5ufonxzfJFsZmlwX2aEcL7Om5yrrF2Zsm66yKumZqqVm8K0sdJmq6hlpJa5rHnAm6aurF2dtrR5zKiqrWWWlrqwwdJmnaKknWK2tXnUqaqerKNitaq5jg%3D%3D</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./real-cousins-niecy-nash-betts-danielle-brooks-and-sterling-k-brown-make-waves-in-hollywood-with-an-estimated-combined-net-worth-of-16m.html><span>←</span><span>Real Cousins Niecy Nash-Betts, Danielle Brooks, And Sterling K.
