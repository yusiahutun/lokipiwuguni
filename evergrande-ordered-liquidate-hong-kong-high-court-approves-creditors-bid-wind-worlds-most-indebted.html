This includes negotiating debt restructuring with creditors and taking control of its assets, books and records, in accordance with the liquidation procedures in Hong Kong.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">Two categories of creditors lay claim to Evergrande’s assets: class A and C. The company’s legal team proposed a “one-class scheme” to work out the group’s debt with both groups, to no avail.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">Creditors will each have to complete and submit a proof of debt form to the provisional liquidators, the court said.

Evergrande has more than 1,200 projects at different stages of progress, ranging from near completion to under construction, according to its 2022 annual report. The developer will “steadily push forward” to ensure homes under construction are delivered to buyers, Xiao said.</p><h3 type=h3 data-qa=Component-Component class="e14khtrb0 css-17x7qa9 e793b7w1"><a class="link-text css-e0dnmk ef1hf1w0" href=# data-qa=BaseLink-renderAnchor-StyledAnchor><p><span data-qa=DigitalArchiveLink-TitleText class="css-66qo9a eeeqn932">Evergrande: default alarms put thousands of suppliers, jobs and economy at risk</span></p></a></h3><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">“The market will pay close attention to what the liquidators can do after being appointed, especially whether they can achieve recognition from any of the three designated courts in the People’s Republic China under the 2021 arrangement regarding cooperation on cross-border insolvency cases between the mainland and Hong Kong,” said Lance Jiang, a partner at Ashurst LLP.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">The designated courts are in Shenzhen, Shanghai and Xiamen, according to the cooperation agreement.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">“The liquidators will have very limited powers of enforcement over onshore assets in mainland China if they cannot get such recognition,” Jiang said.</p><img data-qa=BaseImage-handleRenderImage-StyledImage src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/cdn.i-scmp.com/sites/default/files/styles/wide_landscape/public/d8/video/thumbnail/2023/08/18/thumbnail-clean_0.jpg style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center><p data-qa=SCMPYoutubeVideoPreview-PreviewDuration class="css-dkee4u eaw92su1">03:11</p><p data-qa=SCMPYoutubeVideoPreview-PreviewTitle class="css-1ajvbe4 eaw92su2">China real estate woes: Evergrande files for bankruptcy protection in New York</p><p>China real estate woes: Evergrande files for bankruptcy protection in New York</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">Monday’s order ended Evergrande’s repeated lease on life, where it had been able to persuade the authorities continuously to grant it more time to work out its debt. It won its seventh reprieve on December 4, when creditors surprisingly failed to push for a liquidation.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">An ad hoc group of offshore creditors that collectively hold more than US$6 billion in offshore notes joined the petition to liquidate the company afterwards.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">“While there could be certain offshore assets that provide more readily available recovery, the focus of offshore creditors will be whether the liquidator will succeed in obtaining recognition and help from mainland courts to seize assets [onshore],” Wong said. “For Hong Kong shareholders, the likelihood of obtaining anything from the winding-up process is very low.”</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">Deloitte Advisory (Hong Kong) performed a recovery analysis involving 80 per cent of Evergrande’s net asset value as of November last year. Offshore creditors may be able to recover 9.73 billion yuan in liquidation scenario. Offshore unsecured creditors may recover only 2.05 cents to 3.53 cents for every dollar owed, it estimated, while investors holding Evergrande’s defaulted dollar bonds may get back only 5.92 cents to 9.34 cents per dollar.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">The lawsuit was initiated in June 2022 by Top Shine Global, whose ultimate beneficiary was Lin Ho-man, in an attempt to recover HK$862.5 million (US$110.4 million) from a botched investment in Evergrande made in March 2021.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">Lin, 32, said in an interview with Tencent News earlier this month that he had offloaded his debt holdings in September by selling Top Shine, but did not offer details.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">“The ruling highlights Hong Kong’s vital role as a superconnector between mainland China and the rest of the world,” said Byron Phillips, partner for litigation, arbitration and employment at Hogan Lovells.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">It further dispels any myths advanced in some quarters regarding independence or robustness of the Hong Kong judiciary, he added.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tK%2FMqWWcp51kr7a%2FyKecrKtfmLWqusBmma6rmaOytL%2BOmqmtoZOhsnB%2FkW5naXFmZLK3sdGgqZqmlJp6sL7DnqmenF2htrLByJ2YrZ1dnbyvs4ykpqefXZ22qLSMnKauqqRirrG80aitnqtdmL%2BmsMitpqurXZe2pXnWoqWdZaekv62w0makqKukYravsMSbq56c</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./cassius-marsh-wife-parents-family-height-weight-measurements.html><span>←</span><span>Cassius Marsh Wife, Parents, Family, Height, Weight, Measurements</span></a>
