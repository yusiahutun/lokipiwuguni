The pair appeared to get on well on screen, often sharing long giggles together on-screen.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/i2-prod.dailystar.co.uk/incoming/article32274654.ece/ALTERNATES/s458/1_MAIN_-STAR_WILL.jpg><p>However, it was rumoured that the friendship had turned frosty. Eventually Fern left the show in 2009 after 10 years and was replaced by Holly Willoughby, who had co-hosted with Schofield previously when standing in as holiday and sick cover for Fern. She later said she had felt badly treated on the show. She told RTE radio in 2020: "I began not to enjoy it so much and the morning I resigned, I didn’t know I was going to resign. Something happened and I thought, 'That’s it really' and I walked away and resigned. I was treated pretty poorly, actually. And after a while I just thought, 'Sod it'".</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/s2-prod.mirror.co.uk/@trinitymirrordigital/chameleon-branding/publications/dailystar/img/logo-schema-dailystar.png><p>After Fern left the show there were rumours that she had quit over a pay dispute - because she had discovered that Schofield was paid more £250,000 a year more than her for doing the same job. But Britton has always denied this. She told<a href=# rel=nofollow> Hello! magazine</a>: "That certainly wasn’t true, not least because I had no idea what Phillip had been paid. I knew what I was being paid and it was more than fair.</p><p>"It is appalling that, if you are doing the same job as a man, you are paid less and I am absolutely all for equal pay but at the time, even if Phillip had been paid more than me, he was doing more programmes on television."</p><p><b>Celebrity Big Brother airs Sunday to Friday on ITV1, STV and ITVX at 9pm</b></p><p><b>Want all the biggest Showbiz and TV news straight to your inbox? </b><a data-content-type=section data-link-tracking=InArticle|Link href=#><b>Sign up for our free Daily Star Showbiz newsletter</b></a></p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7pa3IpbCsrJGne6S7ja6iaKymZLqwvs2ipaBlnJq0prrDZp2eqp5ir7O1062mp6tdmLKtscGroK2xXWh%2Fc4OUa2lr</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./unique-android-chatbots.html><span>←</span><span>The 5 Best Android Chatbots That'll Keep You Entertained</span></a>
