Many scenes feel like they may have been pulled from the backyard of the Moore family home.

There are also scenes cut along the beach and in the parking lot of what looks to be a University of Arkansas football game.</p><p>''Til My Last Day' is the third single from Moore's 'Outlaws Like Me' album, following 'If Heaven Wasn't So Far Away' and 'Bait a Hook.' Ella Cole is 2-years-old, while Kennedy was just born last November.
