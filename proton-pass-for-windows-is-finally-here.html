Proton, the company behind Proton Mail and Proton VPN, has been ramping up development of its Proton Pass password manager over the past few months. Now, there's finally a native Proton Pass application for Windows PCs, so you can access your passwords quickly.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Proton has finally taken the step to launch <a href=#>Proton Pass</a> for Windows. This desktop application offers enhanced user experience by seamlessly integrating within the Windows operating system, providing a standalone solution to manage passwords and encrypted login information more conveniently. Proton Pass was already available as a browser extension, so you could use the password manager within websites in your computer. Still, browsers are not the only place where you have to type in passwords. Also, if you switch between multiple browsers on a regular basis, you might not have to install the extension on each one.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>A notable feature of Proton Pass is its offline mode, available for Proton Pass Plus and Unlimited users, ensuring access to stored information without an internet connection. The password manager is using Argon2 encryption, renowned for its resilience against brute-force attacks, so your passwords will be safe from malicious actors. Proton Pass follows a transparent and open development approach, being open-source and independently audited. This commitment to transparency wants to make you feel safe and assured of the robust security foundation underlying the app. You're not just putting your passwords on any password manager; you can also check out how it handles your personal information.</p><p>Proton also has plans to extend support for Proton Pass to macOS and Linux later, so for those of you who have been waiting for it to come to other devices, you'll soon have it—and in the meantime, as we said before, there's a browser extension, albeit it's not the most handy option if you're planning on using those passwords outside of your browser.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>You can <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer sponsored nofollow" class="norewrite noskim">check out Proton Pass</a> from Proton's website. There's a free option available with the core functionality, and there are subscription options available for Pass or Proton's entire app suite.</p><p>Source: <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer sponsored nofollow" class="norewrite noskim">Proton</a></p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7qbvWraagnZWge6S7zGinq6ekpLtuvMCsqmaen6d6uLXNnaawq12ewG6yyKeYpaSpYrWmvsRo</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./noelle-perdue-money-shot.html><span>←</span><span>Noelle Perdue Is Featured in 'Money Shot: The Pornhub Story'</span></a>
