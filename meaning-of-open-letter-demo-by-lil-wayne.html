With thought-provoking lyrics and a heavy emotional undertone, the song creates a space for listeners to reflect on their own journey and the challenges they face along the way.One of the standout lyrics in the song is, "Baby momma say I ain't shit, Make a nigga feel like shit." This lyric highlights the impact of others' opinions and judgments on a person's self-worth. It delves into the notion of how external validation or criticism can affect one's perception of themselves. It explores the themes of identity, acceptance, and the pressures we face to conform to societal expectations.Another powerful lyric in the song is, "My new bitch left me, She said she felt too disrespected, It made no sense to me, But not to the people closest to me, And that's why she left, My smile just left." This lyric delves into the theme of heartbreak and the aftermath of a failed relationship. It touches on the idea that relationships, no matter how strong they appear, can be fragile, and the impact of losing someone can be profound. It delves into the themes of vulnerability, trust, and the inevitable pain that comes with love.The lyric, "Loved ones say I don't love 'em, Make a nigga feel like nothin', A bitch said we never make love, Make a nigga feel like fuckin'," explores the often complex and conflicting emotions that arise within relationships. It delves into the idea that love can sometimes feel inadequate or unreciprocated, leading to doubt and a sense of worthlessness. This lyric connects to the themes of self-doubt, validation, and the fragility of romantic relationships.The line, "I know a lotta niggas think I got a lotta niggas, There's strength in numbers but there's honor over strength," delves into the theme of loyalty and the challenges that come with maintaining genuine connections. It suggests that having a large circle of acquaintances does not necessarily equate to true friendship. It explores the idea that true companionship is rooted in trust, loyalty, and mutual respect.
