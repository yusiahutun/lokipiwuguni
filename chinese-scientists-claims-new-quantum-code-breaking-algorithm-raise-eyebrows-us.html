In it Long’s team said Shor’s algorithm – a mathematical tool developed by American physicist Peter Shor in 1994 that could, in theory, make a quantum computer much faster than a classical computer in code-breaking – performed inefficiently in real quantum circuits.<p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">Based on a controversial algorithm developed by German mathematician Claus Schnorr in 2013, the Chinese team developed a new algorithm called sublinear-resource quantum integer factorisation (SQIF) to optimise the quantum calculation process.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">To demonstrate the feasibility of SQIF, the researchers broke a 48-bit-length encryption key with a tiny 10-qubit superconductive quantum computer at Zhejiang University in Hangzhou.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">It is “the most qubit-saving factorisation algorithm to date,” they said in the paper.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">Because quantum computers handling hundreds of qubits could be developed in the near future, “our study shows great promise in expediting the application of current noisy quantum computers, and paves the way to factor large integers of realistic cryptographic significance,” they added.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">Bruce Schneier, an American cryptographer and computer expert who has testified in the US Congress on information security issues, said the Chinese study “is something to take seriously”.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">“It might not be correct, but it’s not obviously wrong,” Schneier, the chief of security architecture at Inrupt, said in a post on his blog on January 3.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">“And there’s the nagging question of why the Chinese government didn’t classify this research,” he added.</p><h3 type=h3 data-qa=Component-Component class="e14khtrb0 css-17x7qa9 e793b7w1"><a class="link-text css-e0dnmk ef1hf1w0" href=# data-qa=BaseLink-renderAnchor-StyledAnchor><p><span data-qa=DigitalArchiveLink-TitleText class="css-66qo9a eeeqn932">Generative AI, cloud computing and security top tech trends for 2023: Alibaba academy</span></p></a></h3><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">Scott Aaronson, director of the quantum information centre at the University of Texas at Austin, acknowledged Schneier’s concern but said he did not believe Long’s method would work.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">He said a major problem with the paper was its failure to clarify the advantage of quantum technology over classical computers.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">“It seems to me that a miracle would be required for the approach here to yield any benefit at all, compared to just running the classical Schnorr’s algorithm on your laptop,” Scott wrote on his blog.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">“This is one of the most actively misleading quantum computing papers I’ve seen in 25 years, and I’ve seen many,” he added.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">Peter Shor, the professor of applied mathematics at MIT who invented the Shor’s algorithm, posted on Twitter: “There are apparently possible problems with this paper”. He was replying to a post by a scientist in Google’s quantum programme called Craig Gidney, who alleged the Chinese team omitted crucial technical details to back up their claim.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">“If it is true it is catastrophic,” said Lawrence Gasman, founder and president of Inside Quantum Technology, a website on developments in quantum technology.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">“But as one of my old professors at MBA school said, ‘If an idea is interesting it is probably wrong’,” Gasman said. “We should also consider that this emanates from China, a place desperate to prove that it is better than the US.”</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">Long’s collaborators included researchers from the State Key Laboratory of Mathematical Engineering and Advanced Computing, a military-affiliated research institute in Zhengzhou, Henan province. It was established jointly by the PLA’s Information Engineering University and Wuxi Jiangnan Institute of Computing Technology.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">The team could not be reached for comment.</p><img data-qa=BaseImage-handleRenderImage-StyledImage src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/cdn.i-scmp.com/sites/default/files/styles/wide_landscape/public/d8/video/thumbnail/2023/01/06/clean_0.jpg style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center><p data-qa=SCMPYoutubeVideoPreview-PreviewDuration class="css-dkee4u eaw92su1">02:19</p><p data-qa=SCMPYoutubeVideoPreview-PreviewTitle class="css-1ajvbe4 eaw92su2">‘Even great companies failed’: A gallery at the Consumer Electronics Show celebrates tech failures</p><p>‘Even great companies failed’: A gallery at the Consumer Electronics Show celebrates tech failures</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">A Beijing-based cryptographer who knew Long personally said he did not believe the paper was thrown out as a smoke screen to mislead the US and other competing countries with intentional false claims.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">“Professor Long conducts solid research and keeps a low profile. He will not put his academic reputation at stake for the game of geopolitics,” said the researcher who asked not to be named because of the sensitivity of the issue.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">The Beijing source said it was too early to reach a verdict on the paper until it went through rigorous peer review.</p><h3 type=h3 data-qa=Component-Component class="e14khtrb0 css-17x7qa9 e793b7w1"><a class="link-text css-e0dnmk ef1hf1w0" href=# data-qa=BaseLink-renderAnchor-StyledAnchor><p><span data-qa=DigitalArchiveLink-TitleText class="css-66qo9a eeeqn932">US weighs China tech restrictions on quantum computing and AI</span></p></a></h3><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">Sharing the academic findings with the international community would not undermine China’s national security as long as the paper did not contain engineering details on how to scale up the code-breaking capability to practical levels, according to the researcher.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">“The chance that the existing encryption technology is under immediate threat is small.
