<span>Jenniffer Sheldon</span></p><h1>Inside Leonardo DiCaprios US$7 million California mansion: the former home of Batmans Robert P</h1></header><section class=post-content><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">Formerly owned by Modern Family star Jesse Tyler Ferguson, No Doubt singer Gwen Stefani and the next Batman, Robert Pattinson, the Spanish colonial-style home features four bedrooms and six bathrooms. Dating back to 1928, it was completely renovated and redesigned a few years ago by Will & Grace and Entourage set decorator Peter Gurski, soon before DiCaprio’s May 2021 purchase.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">From the moment visitors cross the threshold of the original front door, with its inlaid hand carvings, iron gate and patterned tiled steps, it’s clear the interiors are an interplay of carefully modulated divergence.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/cdn.i-scmp.com/sites/default/files/d8/images/canvas/2022/02/25/f33b43d1-7d56-43d6-8783-a0af68b2cf2b_5af1f92a.jpg><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">In mixing and matching styles, textures, colours and patterns, Gurski has original stained glass and tile work alongside modern touches: stripes butting up against paisley, plush long-pile carpet sitting atop polished wood, and modern furnishings accented by their antique counterparts – sometimes customised to complement the house’s existing architecture. It could easily be a mess of conflicting aesthetics, but instead it’s an elegantly contrasting one.</p><h3 type=h3 data-qa=Component-Component class="e14khtrb0 css-17x7qa9 e793b7w1"><a class="link-text css-e0dnmk ef1hf1w0" href=# data-qa=BaseLink-renderAnchor-StyledAnchor><span data-qa=DigitalArchiveLink-Topic class="css-1wyvcgo e1b1x8aa3"></span><p><span data-qa=DigitalArchiveLink-Title class="css-i31uou e1b1x8aa1">Meet Michael Jackson’s secret half-sister, Joh’Vonnie</span></p></a></h3><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">Surrounded by bougainvillea, pomegranate and avocado trees, and set on multiple interconnecting levels, the home sits on a gentle slope where it pops out of its lush green background with its cyan trim – also applied to the three-car garage – and terra cotta tiling, both of which offset the raised, wraparound pool.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/cdn.i-scmp.com/sites/default/files/d8/images/canvas/2022/02/25/9328c404-43c9-4e99-bea9-4f6e6956bf93_fc8cc252.jpg><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">Outdoor living space is a hallmark of the house, which in addition to the pool level, boasts five sitting areas and an atrium courtyard that ties the interior spaces together. A peaceful terrace tucked away up a short flight of stairs offers spectacular views across Los Angeles and of the iconic Griffith Observatory.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">Viewing the house through any of the doors that open onto the various terraces and gardens, the impression is one of seemingly wilful eclecticism, but the reality couldn’t be farther from the truth. In retaining the home’s stained-glass windows, inlaid ceilings, intricate terra cotta tiling and wrought iron period details, the final product is an exquisite marriage of old and new, brash and understated, form and function.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/cdn.i-scmp.com/sites/default/files/d8/images/canvas/2022/02/25/10f07929-cf8f-4ffa-93b9-7043f9a102d9_e7c32301.jpg><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">The rotunda-shaped entrance, stone-accented hall, arched doorways and soaring ceilings hint at the Spanish architecture within, beginning with a grand curving staircase reaching up to a semi-dome with a birdcage chandelier at its peak. The cool stone hallways lead to the intimate living room and its polished parquet flooring, vaulted ceiling and ample natural light. A Juliet balcony, one of many throughout the house, overlooks the room, which is decorated to feel warm and inviting with a quirky colour mix that distinguishes the gallery wall at one end.</p><h3 type=h3 data-qa=Component-Component class="e14khtrb0 css-17x7qa9 e793b7w1"><a class="link-text css-e0dnmk ef1hf1w0" href=# data-qa=BaseLink-renderAnchor-StyledAnchor><span data-qa=DigitalArchiveLink-Topic class="css-1wyvcgo e1b1x8aa3"></span><p><span data-qa=DigitalArchiveLink-Title class="css-i31uou e1b1x8aa1">4 ways NFL star Tom Brady might add to his US$450m fortune after retiring</span></p></a></h3><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/cdn.i-scmp.com/sites/default/files/d8/images/canvas/2022/02/25/40b57f82-0389-4158-894f-d59279f20cdc_a2afb73a.jpg><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">Contemporary art and graphic prints dot the walls in every room, including in the two-storey library, a simultaneously bold and subdued space. Fitted with a mustard-hued statement sofa, a plaid settee and heavy leather armchairs, wrapped in dark teal walls and deep wood cabinetry, the library is as ideal for entertaining as it is for a quiet snifter of brandy. Similarly the dining room is lined with a studded black wallpaper that heightens the intimate atmosphere, showing how each room has a distinct personality.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">In contrast, the lower level holds the bright, modern kitchen, outfitted in a stainless steel and wood motif. The long hardwood planks under foot and a welcoming island give it the feeling of a social space for gathering as well as cooking. The marble worktop is complemented by more teal – this time on the cabinetry – and the space is completed with a sunny breakfast nook built into a bay window.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/cdn.i-scmp.com/sites/default/files/d8/images/canvas/2022/02/25/a29d9cef-f9be-4c37-8089-c844ff09b8a5_4c5d4de0.jpg><h3 type=h3 data-qa=Component-Component class="e14khtrb0 css-17x7qa9 e793b7w1"><a class="link-text css-e0dnmk ef1hf1w0" href=# data-qa=BaseLink-renderAnchor-StyledAnchor><span data-qa=DigitalArchiveLink-Topic class="css-1wyvcgo e1b1x8aa3"></span><p><span data-qa=DigitalArchiveLink-Title class="css-i31uou e1b1x8aa1">Meet Olympic snowboarder and social media sensation Chloe Kim</span></p></a></h3><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">Upstairs the master suite is the haven it should be, given a quiet and cosy ambience by a soft cloth wallpaper that accentuates the hushed tone of mixed fabrics and finishes. The master bedroom’s private balcony and deco-accented bathroom, vanity and Baden-Baden-style tub complete the space, with the added touch of a hotel-ready dressing room equipped with coffee service. The remaining three bedrooms are fitted out to suit guests of all stripes, and include a colourful nursery decked out with a daybed and comfortable lounger for new parents.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">A spa, detached Zen/meditation/yoga room, a small gym, bespoke office and media room with multiple screens for all manner of viewing occasions add the final touches to the home.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tK%2FMqWWcp51kuqKzwLOgp52jZMC1xcueZpydnJqvs7XTsmaaqqSesK2xjmxob3BjaoJwtc2soJ2dXaGysLrAq5uoZZSesKK80aKmrGWlqIRuucilo6KnnmKworjIn6arppmWeq6tzaygqKY%3D</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./lana-del-rey-dating-history.html><span>←</span><span>From Sean Larkin to Jack Donoghue</span></a>
