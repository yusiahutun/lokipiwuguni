There are four total seasons of Succession.&nbsp;Season 4 premieres on March 26, 2023.</p><h2>Will there be a Succession season 5?</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/stylecaster.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/03/jeremy-strong-sarah-snook-kieran-culkin.jpg><p>Will there be a Succession Season 5? No, season 4 of Succession is the last of the series.</p><p>On the last table read of the series, <a href=# rel=noopener>Nicholas Braun</a> who plays Cousin Greg told <a href=# rel="noopener nofollow">Entertainment Tonight,</a> “We were expecting it while we were making the show, but you don’t believe it till [creator] Jesse [Armstrong] says it.” He continued, “I was sad as hell [on] my last day,” sharing what it was like to wrap production on the upcoming, final episodes. “I finished a couple of weeks ago, and it was a really tough day, you know, saying goodbye to everybody. It’s been the greatest working experience in my life. So, saying goodbye to those people is really tough.”</p><p>Sarah Snook expressed how she was very surprised about the announcement from Jesse Armstrong, “I was very upset,” she told the&nbsp;<a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow">Los Angeles Times</a> in an interview on March 19. “I felt a huge sense of loss, disappointment and sadness. It would have been nice to know at the beginning of the season, but I also understand not being told until the end because there was still a potential that maybe this wasn’t going to be the end.”</p><p>On what to expect from the last season, Jeremy Strong said that there were some complications that were maybe not tidied up by the end to<a href=#> <a href=# id=auto-tag_tv data-tag=tv>TV</a> Insider. </a>&nbsp;“You know, there were many times where I advocated to Jesse, the thing that you’re talking about, this thing that’s lurking in the shadows,” he said about his character Kendall Roy. “You know, I thought about Will Smith sometimes in this sort of zenith moment of life and the way that the shadow can sort of come and knock on your door and unseat you.”</p><p>“So that’s always happening to Kendall,” the actor continued. “I think Jesse [Armstrong] is a more sophisticated writer than I would be. So I think Jesse feels like the way the world works is things don’t always come back around. People actually just get away with things, but you don’t get away with anything karmically psychologically, internally. You are haunted by things and hunted by your own internal demons.”</p><p>He also hinted at even more turmoil among the characters. “Wouldn’t it be great if Season 4 was just like we’re all happy and like spraying each other like in&nbsp;Zoolander at the gas station and everybody gets what they want. But no.”</p><p><i><span>Our mission at STYLECASTER is to bring style to the people, and we only feature products we think you’ll love as much as we do.
