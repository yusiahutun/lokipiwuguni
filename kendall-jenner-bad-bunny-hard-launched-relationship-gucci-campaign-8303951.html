The images, lensed by <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=externalLink data-ordinal=1>Anthony Seklaoui</a>, were shot in an airport and captured Jenner and Bunny parading through a gate in head-to-toe Gucci. In one photo, the two emerge from an escalator with Kenny wearing a micro miniskirt covered in the brand's signature double-G print styled with a white tee and an ankle-length plaid trench coat. For footwear, Jenner opted for white crew socks tucked into chunky loafers with Gucci's famous gold horse-bit detail. She carried a beige logomania bag with neon orange details that matched her carry-on roller suitcase. Black sunglasses gave her the celebrity-in-airport incognito vibe, and her raven hair was worn straight with a middle part.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_6-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">For his part, Bunny wore baggy blue jeans and a white crewneck with a lime green double-G logo on his chest and green-and-white striped detailing along the sleeves and hem. White sneakers, a black beanie, matching sunnies, and a patterned Gucci duffle bag accessorized this look.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_8-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">In a different photo, Kendall sat atop a cart carrying oversized luggage with the designer's logo print and green-and-red stripe details. The model wore black slacks and a matching sweater over a white collared shirt, with sneakers and a tiny red bag finishing off the look.</p><figure id=mntl-sc-block_10-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block instyle-sc-block-image mntl-sc-block-universal-image mntl-sc-block-image--no-theme no-theme mntl-sc-block-image figure-portrait figure-high-res"><span class=figure-article-caption-owner readability=27><p>Anthony Seklaoui for Gucci</p></span></figure><p id=mntl-sc-block_13-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">Bunny appeared to push Jenner and the bags from behind while both he and Kendall had smiles plastered on their faces. In a different snap, Kendall sat in a chair at the gate while resting her foot on her knee. She wore the same outfit accessorized with a double-G belt and a retina-searing lime green-yellow duffle bag and tote bag with matching handles. The new campaign was meant to "embrace the spirit of Gucci Ancora as a celebration of the love," according to a press release.</p><figure id=mntl-sc-block_15-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block instyle-sc-block-image mntl-sc-block-universal-image mntl-sc-block-image--no-theme no-theme mntl-sc-block-image figure-portrait figure-high-res"><span class=figure-article-caption-owner readability=27><p>Anthony Seklaoui for Gucci</p></span></figure><p id=mntl-sc-block_16-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">Rumors of a budding romance between the two superstars started swirling in February of this year. It wasn't long before the duo were spotted in the wild on a plethora of dates that included sushi, horseback riding, and a Coachella appearance. Last week, the two took their romance to Paris Fashion Week, where they <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=internalLink data-ordinal=1>sat together in the front row</a> of Gucci's spring/summer 2024 show.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7qrrSrbClnV6YvK57yp6lnZmcoXqrsc2nnKtlkpaxbq7Up6WyZZiWv6V5y5qsp5uYmrFuvsSlmK2hn6PAqbXPZp6um5OeeqStzKmYop%2BeYoV0fJJybGo%3D</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./love-after-lockup-jessica-doubts-maurice-using-her-preview-video.html><span>←</span><span>Jessica Has Doubts &amp;amp; Worries Maurice Is Using Her Hollywood Life</span></a>
