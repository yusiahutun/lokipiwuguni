But as with so many online games, it is unfortunately hit by connection errors from time to time. One such error is when the game gets stuck on the "connecting to the CS:GO network" screen.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>The error mainly results from a weak internet connection, but sometimes, an in-app issue can also be the culprit. In this article, we'll examine what this error is and how you can overcome it.</p><h2 id=why-do-i-get-stuck-on-quot-connecting-to-the-cs-go-network-quot>Why Do I Get Stuck on "Connecting to the CS:GO Network"?</h2><p>The "connecting to the CS:GO network" issue is one of the game's most prevalent. This error mainly appears when there is an issue in your current network connection. However, you also might face the problem due to corrupt game files, misconfigured network settings, or a VPN service.</p><p>Whether it's due to network issues, or in-app problems, we're here to help. Here are six ways to troubleshoot the "connecting to the CS:GO network" hangup.</p><h2 id=try-performing-basic-repairs>1. Try Performing Basic Repairs</h2><p>Before diving into the technical fixes, make sure to restart the game at least once. There's a possibility that the error can appear due to a temporary in-game glitch. To fix this, consider restarting the game.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Connection errors in any online game often result from a weak internet connection. You can confirm this by visiting an <a href=#>internet speed-checking website</a>.</p><p>If the result shows that you are connected to an unstable or weak connection, consider restarting your network devices. You can also contact your ISP if restarting the network device doesn't fix your slow speeds.</p><p>The next thing you should check is CS:GO's server status. You can check it by visiting websites like <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Downdetector</a>.</p><p>If the CS:GO servers are down, that means the issue lies with Valve's servers, not your hardware. The only solution is to wait until the servers become operational again.</p><h2 id=enable-data-execution-prevention>2. Enable Data Execution Prevention</h2><p><a href=#>Data Execution Prevention</a> is a memory-protection feature that stops malicious code exploits. It keeps an eye on specific memory regions and prevents them from executing malicious codes.</p><p>You can resolve the "connecting to the CS:GO network" issue simply by enabling DEP on your computer.

You can usually do it by right-clicking on the security application icon in the Taskbar and choosing "Disable" from the context menu.

Switch to Google Public DNS</h2><p>The next solution on the list is to switch DNS.

Repair CS:GO'sFiles</h2><p>The "connecting to the CS:GO network" issue can also stem from corrupted CS:GO files.
