Later, it would be sung by folk and pop singer Maria Muldaur, country-rock singer Early Scruggs Revue, and Parton’s childhood favorite, Rose Maddox.</p><p>Walkin’ home from church on a Sunday with the one ya’ love<br>Just laughin’, talkin’, making future plans<br>And when the folks ain’t lookin’, you might steal a kiss or two<br>Sittin’ in the porch swing, holdin’ hands</p>“My Tennessee Mountain Home” by Dolly Parton<p id=par-3_11>Patron’s favorite line from the song comes in the chorus.</p><p id=par-4_45>“One of my favorite lines in this song is ‘Life is as peaceful as a baby’s sigh,'” wrote Parton. “We always had plenty of babies, and there’s nothing like holding a little baby after he’s bawled his head off and finally gone to sleep.”</p><h2 id=h-dolly-parton-reminisces-about-her-country-home>Dolly Parton reminisces about her country home</h2><figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-video is-provider-youtube wp-block-embed-youtube wp-embed-aspect-16-9 wp-has-aspect-ratio" id=emb-2><p></p></figure><p id=par-5_16>Parton went on to write about the scenes from <a href=#>her childhood</a> that inspired the song.</p><p id=par-6_100>“I love being a mountain girl, a country girl,” she wrote. “And I’ve written so many songs about it. ‘My Tennessee Mountain Home’ really talks about sitting on a front porch, leaning back like we used to, singing, and having peaceful times. <a href=#>There were hard times</a>, too. But when you grow up in the mountains, you’re not working every second. If it’s right after supper and you’re with your mom and dad, everything seems to be calm. There are those moments when you talk about peaceful things—lightning bugs out in the fields, kids running around doing whatever, and thinking back.”</p><h2 id=h-dolly-parton-s-home-was-full-of-music>Dolly Parton’s home was full of music</h2><p id=par-7_22>Parton wasn’t the only musician in her family. Her siblings played music and sang, as did her aunts, uncles, and cousins.</p><p id=par-8_85>“We would all set out on the porch and play music,” she wrote. “We were always together, singing songs. Whether it would be aunts and uncles, cousins, brothers, and sisters, we would kind of branch out into little groups. Whether it was a little trio that was asked to go sing at a funeral, or if it was a bunch of us that were asked to go play at a barn dance, we could do it. And we certainly all used to sing in church.”</p><figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-rich is-provider-twitter wp-block-embed-twitter" id=emb-3><p lang=en dir=ltr>Growing up in the mountains, we used to sit on the front porch and listen to the beautiful sounds of nature….like a songbird's melody or crickets singing in the fields nearby.

She learned different instruments from different relatives.</p><p id=par-10_74>“Most of us in the household learned to play early on,” she wrote. “Every time anybody would show up, any uncle or aunt who knew how to play an instrument, I’d have them show me how to play a little bit on the banjo, the guitar, an autoharp, or whatever instrument was around. I wanted to find different sounds, so I would just have anybody help me. Because I wanted to write songs.”</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7pLTEmqusoJWawW%2BvzqZmnqakmr%2B1rcinpJ6mpGSxsLjLsmSpmaKpvK95xZqtqKqZqbJuuMinnGalqWLBprrNnqqsnZViurDBza2YoqZdnbyusY2hq6akXw%3D%3D</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./sharon-shenocca.html><span>←</span><span>Sharon Shenocca Biography</span></a>
