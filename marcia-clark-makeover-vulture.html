Simpson: American Crime Story"</strong> was called "Marcia, Marcia, Marcia" - and the real Marcia, Marcia, Marcia has some thoughts on it!</p><p>As the title suggests, the episode revolved around prosecutor <strong>Marcia Clark</strong>, played with spellbinding detail by <strong>Sarah Paulson</strong>, and the way the trial messed with her personal life...including the notorious new 'do she got while the case was heating up.</p><p>In an interview with <strong><a href=#>Vulture</a></strong> posted Thursday night, the iconic lawyer, 62, quips, "How could I have had a makeover and still looked that bad?"</p><p>The idea that she deliberately redid her image, she insists, "was a media creation."</p><p>The truth? While battling a divorce and custody battle at home and <strong>Johnnie Cochran</strong> at work, Marcia Clark's hair was, understandably, low on her priorities list, and she just kind of let it do its thing.</p><a class="media-link image-block__link js-track-link" href=#><img src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/images.toofab.com/image/93/o/2016/03/09/93d6851316c25cc3b29257283f8687e1_md.jpg style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center></a> <span class="media-credit image-block__media-credit">FX</span><p>"In the very beginning of the case, before opening statements, our press person said, 'You need to get a haircut. You look kind of messy.' And I did. I was kind of scraggly. So I got my hair cut. That was it," she explains.</p><p>"There came that point in the trial when my perm grew out," she continues. "I didn't have the time to go and get permed again. That particular morning I looked at myself and I said, Just blow it out and stop trying. Thus began the media parade about the makeover."</p><p>FYI: We'll see the straighter locks on Paulson next week.</p><p>Marcia adds that she did get an unlikely style savior in the form of <strong>Gil Garcetti</strong>, who was then L.A.'s District Attorney. "Behind the scenes, very quietly, he got suits donated to me that were much nicer than the ones I had," Clark reveals.</p><p>"He did it, I think," she says, "because the media was kicking me all over the place about my off-the-rack suits."</p><p>Check out the gallery above to see what Marcia looks like NOW -- as well as the rest of the major trial players!</p><p>Be sure to keep up with "The People v. O.J. Simpson: American Crime Story," Tuesdays at 10 p.m. on FX.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmisn6Szoq6NnKamZ2Jlfnd7j2xmaXFfoq6zr8iaZJykkae4brnApJyorpWnerfBy62sq51f</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./zoe-colletti.html><span>←</span><span>Zoe Colletti Biography, Age, Height, Boyfriend, Net Worth</span></a>
