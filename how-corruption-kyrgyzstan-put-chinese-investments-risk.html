When Kazakhstan’s <a rel=nofollow class="euc41pk0 e13op9j60 e1qbu6wp1 css-jgjyn2 ef1hf1w0" href=# data-qa=BaseLink-renderAnchor-StyledAnchor><span data-qa=Component-Text class="css-0 e1qbu6wp0">Khorgos dry port</span></a> became operational on the Kazakh-Chinese border, it overtook Kyrgyzstan’s Dordoi market as Central Asia’s prime source of Chinese products. The At-Bashy logistics hub was planned to rival Khorgos, given its proximity to Uzbekistan, where economic opening up has welcomed a large volume of Chinese products.<p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">Back in 2013, China had hoped that the Central Asian nation could play a concrete role in the Belt and Road Initiative. The At-Bashy project fits all the belt and road connectivity descriptions. After all, the goal of China’s land-based trade route is diversification; reliance on Kazakhstan as the sole viable way for cargo to travel west could only be a short-term solution.</p><img data-qa=BaseImage-handleRenderImage-StyledImage src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/cdn4.i-scmp.com/sites/default/files/styles/wide_landscape/public/video/thumbnail/beltandroad_thumbnail_landscape.jpg style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center><p data-qa=SCMPYoutubeVideoPreview-PreviewDuration class="css-dkee4u eaw92su1">02:35</p><p data-qa=SCMPYoutubeVideoPreview-PreviewTitle class="css-1ajvbe4 eaw92su2">Belt and Road Initiative explained</p><p>Belt and Road Initiative explained</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">For Liu Ying, the lead Chinese investor behind the At-Bashy logistic hub, it was a dream come true. According to the Overseas Chinese Service Centre in Bishkek, he had lived in Kyrgyzstan for over 20 years and genuinely believed that the hub was a win-win for both the Central Asian nation and China. He had a well-connected local business partner, who helped arrange for Kyrgyz officials to visit logistics hub in Belarus, Kazakhstan and Uzbekistan. Everything seemed to be going well; construction began in December 2019 after a ceremony attended by then Kyrgyz prime minister Mukhammedkalyi Abylgaziev and Chinese ambassador Du Dewen.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">But Liu’s dream quickly evaporated. Local anti-China fears spread immediately after the ceremony, sparking a number of protests in January and February. When almost 1,000 local residents showed up on February 17, some on horseback, no local officials were willing to stand behind this project.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">There have been other similar cases, and Chinese investors are growing wary of doing business with Kyrgyz elites.</p>The difficulties of doing business in the country must be clear to Beijing now, especially after former Kyrgyz prime minister Sapar Isakov <a class="euc41pk0 e13op9j60 e1qbu6wp1 css-jgjyn2 ef1hf1w0" href=# data-qa=BaseLink-renderAnchor-StyledAnchor><span data-qa=Component-Text class="css-0 e1qbu6wp0">was convicted</span></a> in June of corruption relating to a Chinese power plant contract in Bishkek. The Chinese company that built the plant is blamed for Bishkek residents having to survive the freezing winter without power a couple of years ago.Widespread anti-China sentiment in Kyrgyzstan is effectively standing in the way of future Chinese projects in the country. The Central Asian elites, who profited from Beijing while digging their country into deep <a class="euc41pk0 e13op9j60 e1qbu6wp1 css-jgjyn2 ef1hf1w0" href=# data-qa=BaseLink-renderAnchor-StyledAnchor><span data-qa=Component-Text class="css-0 e1qbu6wp0">debt trap</span></a>, further fuel this sentiment.<img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/cdn.i-scmp.com/sites/default/files/styles/wide_landscape/public/d8/video/thumbnail/2020/10/07/clean_0.jpg><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">Kyrgyzstan owes China about US$1.7 billion, approximately half of the country’s external debt. In several video conferences earlier this year, some also attended by other countries, the Kyrgyz leadership repeatedly asked China for debt relief – that went awkwardly unanswered.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">Even as the protests against the At-Bashy logistics hub were raging, a Chinese company, Xinjiang Hualing Industry and Trade, visited Tashkent to discuss setting up a logistics hub in Syrdarya, at the border area between Uzbekistan and Kazakhstan. By late March, when it was certain that the At-Bashy logistics hub had been scrapped, the Chinese company confirmed that the Syrdarya project would go ahead, effectively isolating Kyrgyzstan from China’s regional logistics network.</p><h3 type=h3 data-qa=Component-Component class="e14khtrb0 css-17x7qa9 e793b7w1"><a class="link-text css-e0dnmk ef1hf1w0" href=# data-qa=BaseLink-renderAnchor-StyledAnchor><p><span data-qa=DigitalArchiveLink-TitleText class="css-66qo9a eeeqn932">Kyrgyzstan unrest ‘may scare off’ future Chinese, other foreign investors</span></p></a></h3>By October 13, former lawmaker <a class="euc41pk0 e13op9j60 e1qbu6wp1 css-jgjyn2 ef1hf1w0" href=# data-qa=BaseLink-renderAnchor-StyledAnchor><span data-qa=Component-Text class="css-0 e1qbu6wp0">Sadyr Japarov</span></a> has entered the limelight as a leadership figure.

Disconcertingly, some media reports link Japarov to Raimbek Matraimov, a notorious power broker whose riches came from controlling customs on the highway between China and Kyrgyzstan.A local narrative blaming China for these development is already circulating. On October 13, former Kyrgyz former lawmaker and anti-corruption activist Shirin Aitmatova <a rel=nofollow class="euc41pk0 e13op9j60 e1qbu6wp1 css-jgjyn2 ef1hf1w0" href=# data-qa=BaseLink-renderAnchor-StyledAnchor><span data-qa=Component-Text class="css-0 e1qbu6wp0">tweeted</span></a> that China influenced the election in Kyrgyzstan through Chinese agent Habibullah Abdukadyr. Abdukadyr, a China-born Uygur, is a kingpin of the underground trade in Kyrgyzstan, who, according to <a class="euc41pk0 e13op9j60 e1qbu6wp1 css-jgjyn2 ef1hf1w0" href=# data-qa=BaseLink-renderAnchor-StyledAnchor><span data-qa=Component-Text class="css-0 e1qbu6wp0">a report</span></a> by the Organised Crime and Corruption Reporting Project, Radio Free Europe/Radio Liberty’s Kyrgyz service and the independent Kyrgyz news website Kloop.kg, is involved with helping Matraimov smuggle money to Istanbul and Dubai.<p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">If gone unaddressed, corruption in Kyrgyzstan will continue to fuel anti-China sentiment in the country, putting any future Chinese projects at risk.
