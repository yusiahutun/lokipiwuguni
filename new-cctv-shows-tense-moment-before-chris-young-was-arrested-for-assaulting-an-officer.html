He can be seen lightly touching one on the arm, what seems like an attempt to grab his attention, however it goes downhill from there.</p><p>Young (in the leather coat and cap) can then be seen being involved in an altercation with the said agent, with force strong enough to send the singer ‘flying’ back.</p><p>The season 4 winner of the television program, Nashville Star, can then be seen falling over a stool at the Dawg House bar.</p><p>In the arrest affidavit <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">obtained</a> by&nbsp;Rolling Stone, it was alleged the singer “blocked” the agents from leaving the establishment and he “put his hands out to stop me [the agent] from leaving the bar and stuck me on the shoulder.”</p><p>However, new CCTV is now circulating following the claims. NC5’s Nick Beres, who obtained the video, <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">wrote</a> (in part) on his Facebook page: “You’ll recall Young was&nbsp;arrested for disorderly conduct, resisting arrest and assault of an officer for allegedly attacking agents with the Alcoholic Beverage Commission.</p><p>“He is waiting to ask the men why they took a photo of his ID and reaches out to ask the agent to stop to talk. The agent then shoves Young knocking him to the floor. According to Young’s lawyer, all his client wanted to do was to confirm the identity of the men — who were not in obvious uniforms … and ask about the photo of his ID,” he writes.</p><p>Nick also spoke to Young’s lawyer, who reportedly alleged: “What happened to his client in the Dawg House was wrong … that he never should have been arrested … and that ABC should drop the charges and apologize.”</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading id=h-the-star-is-set-to-appear-in-court-before-his-album-release-date>The star is set to appear in court before his album release date</h2><p>Investigators are yet to respond following the CCTV footage of Chris Young.</p><p>Following his arrest, the Famous Friends singer was taken into custody before he was released on bond “of $250 for the disorderly conduct charge, $1,000 for the resisting arrest charge and $1,250 for the assault charge,” PEOPLE <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">reports</a>.</p><p>The publication states he is due to appear in court on February 16, just over a month before his new album, Young Love & Saturday Nights is scheduled to drop on March 22.</p><p>Related Topics</p><p>MORE CELEBRITY STORIES</p><span></span><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7pLHLnpmroaSuwaqwwaKrZ5ufonxzfJFtZmlpX2eBcLrEsGScm6SrerS0zrCqZqyVo8CmecyopJ6mpGKvprLOq5xmm5intrR52Kisp59drK60ecCrqZ6rpJqxbrLOq2Saq6OWwq3AyKeeZpmeYrynssicnKtn</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./mindy-kaling-andie-swim-swimsuit-collection-7495986.html><span>←</span><span>Mindy Kaling Just Launched a Swimsuit Collection With Andie Swim</span></a>
