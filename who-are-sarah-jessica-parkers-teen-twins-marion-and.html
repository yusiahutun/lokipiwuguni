The couple tried multiple options to give their son a sibling, and eventually decided to go down the surrogate route – a choice that’d give so much joy to the family. In 2009, Parker and Broderick happily welcomed their twins, Marion Loretta Elwell Broderick and Tabitha Hodge Broderick, on June 22 in Ohio, per People.</p><h3 type=h3 data-qa=Component-Component class="e14khtrb0 css-17x7qa9 e793b7w1"><strong data-qa=ContentSchemaRender-defaultRenderMapFunctions-Component-0 class="css-1mniedq eq9i94316">Marion and Tabitha’s sibling James Wilkie was thrilled to become a big brother</strong></h3><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/cdn.i-scmp.com/sites/default/files/d8/images/canvas/2022/10/03/a4228553-e571-40b5-8afc-c12ae831282a_ccfcc5a5.jpg><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">Breaking the news to James Wilkie, who was then six years old, was something that Parker had been “pretty candid with” she told Access Hollywood. Naturally wanting to keep mum about the news until the time was right, Parker didn’t want her son to be “burdened with a secret” and was “very careful about telling him”.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">“On the other hand, I wanted him to have time to adjust to the idea of sharing his mama and his papa,” recalled Parker. And so they eventually told the young James Wilkie, and realised that their son was “ready to be an older brother”. Awaiting his soon-to-be baby sisters gave him a “sense of pride”, she said.</p><h3 type=h3 data-qa=Component-Component class="e14khtrb0 css-17x7qa9 e793b7w1"><strong data-qa=ContentSchemaRender-defaultRenderMapFunctions-Component-0 class="css-1mniedq eq9i94316">Both girls wanted to be carried at the same time</strong></h3><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/cdn.i-scmp.com/sites/default/files/d8/images/canvas/2022/10/03/97799a84-cf84-47fd-a546-0980cf55adae_649c1fb9.jpg>Known for her eternally slim figure, motherhood seemed to have played a big role in keeping Parker fit through <a class="euc41pk0 e13op9j60 e1qbu6wp1 css-jgjyn2 ef1hf1w0" href=# data-qa=BaseLink-renderAnchor-StyledAnchor><span data-qa=Component-Text class="css-0 e1qbu6wp0">all these years</span></a>. In 2011, on a UK show called This Morning, she shared, “Well, honestly, my daughters insist on being carried at the exact same time.”<p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">“They’re like 25 pounds [11kg] now each,” she added. Quite the workout for the working mum!</p><h3 type=h3 data-qa=Component-Component class="e14khtrb0 css-17x7qa9 e793b7w1"><a class="link-text css-e0dnmk ef1hf1w0" href=# data-qa=BaseLink-renderAnchor-StyledAnchor><span data-qa=DigitalArchiveLink-Topic class="css-1wyvcgo e1b1x8aa3"></span><p><span data-qa=DigitalArchiveLink-Title class="css-i31uou e1b1x8aa1">What would Princess Diana, Elvis Presley and Michael Jackson look like now?</span></p></a></h3><h3 type=h3 data-qa=Component-Component class="e14khtrb0 css-17x7qa9 e793b7w1"><strong data-qa=ContentSchemaRender-defaultRenderMapFunctions-Component-0 class="css-1mniedq eq9i94316">Unique personalities and fashion styles</strong></h3><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/cdn.i-scmp.com/sites/default/files/d8/images/canvas/2022/10/03/70e126e6-c667-4426-85db-36c3683783c2_5e68c359.jpg><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">Despite being together since birth, Tabitha and Marion appear to be in touch with their unique identities – and are embracing their differences. “They have different interests,” Parker told People. “They’re really devoted to each other, but they’ll also say, ‘I need time away from her.’”</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">As per posts on Parker’s Instagram, Tabitha’s taken up an interest in sewing clothes. “Tabitha can play by herself for hours. Loretta always needs to be checking in,” the actress added.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">Her daughters have established their own personalities and preferences with Parker admitting she sometimes forgets they’re twins. She added that they go to different schools, which was decided based on Tabitha’s idea.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">Fast forward to today, and Tabitha and Marion showcase their differing tastes in their choice of red carpet outfits, too. At the Hocus Pocus 2 premiere, beside their fashionable mother wearing a floral embellished jacket and silky pink harem pants, Tabitha chose to wear an understated LBD, while Marion opted for a shimmering number. Both daughters were proudly in peep-toe heels from their mother’s SJP Collection.</p><h3 type=h3 data-qa=Component-Component class="e14khtrb0 css-17x7qa9 e793b7w1"><a class="link-text css-e0dnmk ef1hf1w0" href=# data-qa=BaseLink-renderAnchor-StyledAnchor><span data-qa=DigitalArchiveLink-Topic class="css-1wyvcgo e1b1x8aa3"></span><p><span data-qa=DigitalArchiveLink-Title class="css-i31uou e1b1x8aa1">Which celebrities revealed pregnancies on the red carpet in 2022?</span></p></a></h3><h3 type=h3 data-qa=Component-Component class="e14khtrb0 css-17x7qa9 e793b7w1"><strong data-qa=ContentSchemaRender-defaultRenderMapFunctions-Component-0 class="css-1mniedq eq9i94316">The twins still enjoy fun, childlike activities with their mum</strong></h3><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">On her Instagram, the actress likes to occasionally share the sweet everyday moments she has with her children. During Easter of last year, she posted a box of colourful eggs, and wrote that “they still want to do this”, referring to an egg hunt.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">“It’s still always a surprise,” Parker wrote on the caption, as her daughters know anyway that it’s their mother who’s hiding the eggs, and there’s no Easter bunny involved.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tK%2FMqWWcp51kuqKzwLOgp52jZMC1xcueZpydnJqvs7XTsmaaqqSesK2xjmxocmxmbIJww8eoZJqqlWLAor7AoWSjnaOotqStjKmYq6OVp8BuwMSepWasp567tHnMmqmip55irq%2Bw</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./verizon-bundle-netflix-amc-plus.html><span>←</span><span>Verizon's Newest Bundle Has Ad-Free Netflix and AMC+</span></a>
