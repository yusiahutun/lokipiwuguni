<a href=../../../chris-young-vince-gill-sober-saturday-night.html></a>
Chris Young’s "Sober Saturday Night" is an undeniably traditional country ballad that finds the singer healing heartbreak with heavy amounts of self-pity. Sparse production frames this vocal showcase — a made-for-a-television-awards-show moment with Vince Gill.
Gill provides heavy harmonies at the chorus, and his voice is an interesting contrast to Young’s deep baritone. While Young muscles his way through the hurt, the country legend is more delicate. This dichotomy makes the unlikely pair a compelling listen.</article><article class=post-entry><h2>Grateful Dead Meet Up At The Movies Goes Global</h2><time>Jun 30, 2024</time>

March 14, 2023 When it’s hot and sunny outside, I can do computers inside in the nice air conditioning.
