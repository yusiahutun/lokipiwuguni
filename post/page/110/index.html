The ex-wife and son of Maine mass shooter Robert Card were in hiding as the manhunt for the killer continued for over 48 hours, before he was found dead Friday evening of an apparent self-inflicted gunshot wound.&nbsp;
Cara Lamb, 39, whom Card married in 2005 and divorced two years later, shares an 18-year-old son Colby with the gunman, according to court records reported by the New York Post.&nbsp;
The terrified pair were understood to be in hiding while Card remained a fugitive-at-large, amid reports that he had been searching for an ex when he carried out the shooting that left 18 dead.</article><article class=post-entry><h2>Stuffed pigs trotter, the Pierre Koffman way cookbook tells you how to make it</h2><time>Apr 10, 2024</time>
<a href=../../../stuffed-pigs-trotter-pierre-koffman-way-cookbook.html></a>
One of the dishes I have been longing to try is Pierre Koffmann’s stuffed pig’s trotter. I read about it years ago, but I’m still no closer to eating it. I can’t try it at any of the London-based French chef’s restaurants, because he no longer has any (his last place, Koffmann’s, at The Berkeley hotel in the British capital, closed in 2016). And, after looking at the recipe in Classic Koffmann (2016), I know I won’t be cooking it.</article><article class=post-entry><h2>The 15 Best Moisturizers With SPF in 2024</h2><time>Apr 10, 2024</time>

The reality is that true sunscreens have higher SPF levels compared to moisturizers, which often max out at SPF 30. Likewise, sunscreens are often formulated to bear the elements like sweat, whereas moisturizers with SPF are usually not.
Moisturizer with SPF isn't as ideal as traditional sunscreen, but it's a practical choice, especially if it seamlessly fits into your morning routine. Just be sure to apply the amount directed on the packaging to ensure you reap the full SPF protection.</article><article class=post-entry><h2>Tim McGraw Adds Multiple New Dates To His Standing Room Only Tour</h2><time>Apr 10, 2024</time>

<a href=../../../woman-34hh-breasts-told-doctor-not-reduction-women-pay-lovely-breasts-html.html></a>
A fashion retail supervisor with 'painful' 34HH boobs claims a female doctor told her not to get a reduction - because other women 'have paid thousands to have lovely breasts like yours'.&nbsp;
Victoria Gilbert, from Brentford, West London, said she went to visit her GP for a check-up in March 2020 and described how her 8lb breasts cause chronic back pain and red welts on her skin.
The 28-year-old was flabbergasted when the doctor reportedly told her not to have a breast reduction because they're 'lovely' and that many women would pay for a bigger bust like hers.</article><article class=post-entry><h2>Zooey Deschanel's Husband Jacob Pechenik Files for Divorce</h2><time>Apr 9, 2024</time>

A Lhasa resident, who identified himself as Sam Wang, said he had been locked in his home for 36 days so far.
“It is extremely difficult to get food and many people have run out of food. I feel we are in the same situation as Ili [prefecture in Xinjiang],” Wang said.
The Ili city government apologised after acute shortages of food and essential items earlier this month prompted residents to take to social media to complain, triggering an online backlash.</article><article class=post-entry><h2>How you could be paid $1000 to watch Greys Anatomy</h2><time>Apr 9, 2024</time>

Parker McCollum can't quite crack a cold, cold heart in "To Be Loved&nbsp;by You," his new radio single and a new way of looking at a man who played heartbreaker with his debut.
"Pretty Heart" found the Texan mourning a&nbsp;woman that he foolishly let slip away. If you like a narrative, you can call this Part 2 in his quest for true love and subtitle it "Karma." There's nothing to indicate the two mid-tempo rockers are connected ever, even if vocally McCollum delivers each in a similar range.</article><article class=post-entry><h2>Vera Wang and Theia unveil crop top wedding dress at bridal week</h2><time>Apr 9, 2024</time>
