I wasn't really thinking at all. It was just so stupid.'</p><p class=mol-para-with-font>As she was further grilled over her motivation for smuggling the drugs, for which she was going to be paid £5,000, she added: 'I was just stupid.'</p><p class=mol-para-with-font>During the interview, Morgan quizzed Michaella over the money she was set to make from writing her book&nbsp;High: My Prison Journey as One of the Infamous Peru Two.&nbsp;</p><p class=mol-para-with-font>Responding to his criticism, Michaella revealed she planned to spend any money she might make from the book to 'pay back debts'.</p><p class=mol-para-with-font>She insisted that she had turned down several TV shows and interviews which had offered her money to tell her story after she had returned from Peru.</p><p class=mol-para-with-font>In 2021, Michaella's five-part documentary, also called High, was released on Netflix in which she relived her story.</p><p class=mol-para-with-font>The show reached the number six spot in South Africa, Canada, Slovenia, Switzerland and Czech Republic, seventh in Netherlands and eighth in Sweden, Austria and Romania.&nbsp;</p><p class=mol-para-with-font>During the documentary, she recalled the terror she felt at the prospect of spending 15 years in Ancon 2, one of South America's fearsome maximum-security women prisons - which made her 'want to do something stupid'.</p><p class=mol-para-with-font>'The whole place was just so toxic, everything about it was toxic, the majority of the people were toxic,' she said. 'The first thing I noticed about Ancon was it was just so manic and crazy and noisy, it sounded like a zoo.</p><p class=mol-para-with-font>'It just felt like you were in this madhouse. There was this woman... she had caught her husband having an affair and she had killed their child, and then she fed it to her husband in a stew.</p><p class=mol-para-with-font>'I've never been so scared and I was obviously really intimidated because we were foreign... One of the things I noticed about Ancon quite quickly was they were just so active sexually.</p><p class=mol-para-with-font>'I'd never actually seen people be so open about their sexuality, I was shocked that they were doing that kind of thing quite openly.</p><p class=mol-para-with-font>'Nobody was really making that big of an issue so I didn't really want to make an issue of it either, but I felt uncomfortable that was happening so close to me.</p><p class=mol-para-with-font>'The way people would behave like that and the fact I couldn't understand a word anyone was saying just added to this whole confusing mad feel of the place where you never knew what was going to happen next.'&nbsp;</p><p class=mol-para-with-font>As the show launched, she posted a series of glamorous snaps on Instagram in which she celebrated her latest project with a Netflix-branded cake.</p><p class=mol-para-with-font>She wrote: 'F****** celebration cake! Netflix worldwide weekend.'</p><p class=mol-para-with-font>The BBC later confirmed Michaella had not received payment for the documentary.</p><p class=mol-para-with-font>After recalling the horror of being imprisoned in a notorious maximum security jail, Michaella told how she used every possible opportunity to prove she was trustworthy.</p><p class=mol-para-with-font>This included working in the prison's beauty salon and learning Spanish so she could befriend other inmates and become their delgada (representative).</p><p class=mol-para-with-font>'I learned the prison had their very own beauty salon, more like a few chairs and mirrors and a concrete room, but for me it was heaven,' she told the programme.&nbsp;</p><p class=mol-para-with-font>'I got a job and I would do different hair treatments, colouring and cutting, blow-dries, waxing, nails, massage. I had no real qualifications, I was winging it but I was good at it. I had a lot of clients.</p><p class=mol-para-with-font>'I really did try to improve things; I got water filters so we could all have clean water and a microwave, and we would have evenings where we have an hour of dancing.'</p><p class=mol-para-with-font>Her 'lucky break' finally came in 2015 when she met a man called Fernando who worked at the local courtroom and hired himself out to prisoners who were fed up with waiting for their parole paperwork on the side.</p><p class=mol-para-with-font>For a healthy fee he would grease the appropriate wheels to expedite his clients’ case, so Michaella paid the bribe and made an impassioned plea for freedom.</p><p class=mol-para-with-font>'I wanted them to understand how the mistakes I’d made in the past had given me this chance to learn and grow,' she said.</p><p class=mol-para-with-font>She was released in 2016 and told how she and her mother 'hugged like freaks for 10 minutes' before the guards told her to leave. Michaella then helped arrange for Reid to expedite her parole hearing.</p><p class=mol-para-with-font>'When you’re young you don’t know it all. I made a dreadful mistake and I regret it, but what prison taught me made me who I am today and that’s a better person than I would have been otherwise,' she said. 'I am a mam now and I am going to get on with being the best one I can.'</p><p class=mol-para-with-font>Meanwhile in an interview following her release, Melissa, who was 19 at the time of her arrest, admitted she had smuggled the drugs for the cash - and the chance to boast about her exploits.</p><p class=mol-para-with-font>She said: 'I was taking drugs - ecstasy, ketamine and cocaine - and on a downward spiral and it wasn't going to end well.</p><p class=mol-para-with-font>‘In Ibiza there are strong influences and everyone is taking drugs - it becomes completely normal. I got swept up in that.’</p><p class=mol-para-with-font>Melissa added: ‘I thought it sounded like a challenge and was blasé about it.</p><p class=mol-para-with-font>'I was offered £4,000 but it wasn't just about the money. I had saved up before I left Scotland so I had cash for rent. I didn't owe any money or anything. I just wanted to be able to boast about it.'</p><p class=mol-para-with-font>But she admitted: ‘I honestly think that if I had carried on the way I was going I would be dead right now.</p><p class=mol-para-with-font>‘I never worried about being caught. I never really thought about what I was doing.</p><p class=mol-para-with-font>‘I think I wanted to be this big person that I’m not.’</p><p class=mol-para-with-font><span class=mol-style-bold>CAREER</span></p><img id=i-2f80c5ead6452bf4 src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2023/07/12/11/72470621-12287511-Melissa_pictured_and_fellow_smuggler_Michaella_McCollum_Conolly_-m-48_1689159119439.jpg height=883 width=634 alt="After returning home from Peru, Melissa took up a fitness regime and set about dedicating herself to helping others -
