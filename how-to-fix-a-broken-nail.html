We asked three celebrity nail artists to tell us why nails break in the first place, how to fix them, alternative ways to deal with them until your next trip to the salon, and more.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_9-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">Here's what they had to say.</p><span class=heading-toc id=toc-what-causes-nails-to-break></span><h2 id=mntl-sc-block_11-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block instyle-sc-block-heading mntl-sc-block-heading"><span class=mntl-sc-block-heading__text>What Causes Nails to Break?</span></h2><p id=mntl-sc-block_12-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">Even if you have incredibly strong nails, they can still break if you're rough with them. "Doing the dishes, lifting a box or even tapping my nails the wrong way have caused them to break in the past," shares <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=externalLink data-ordinal=1>Rita Remark</a>, essie's Global Lead Educator and Nail Artist. However, she says that what makes nails more prone to breakage is when they're weak or brittle.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_14-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">"The nail becomes brittle and weak when exposed to harsh chemicals such as acetone, cleaning supplies, gels, or acrylics," explains <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=externalLink data-ordinal=1 rel=nofollow>Jin Soon Choi</a>, an editorial manicurist and founder of her eponymous salon and nail product brand. "They can also become brittle and weak when you have gel or nail polish on your nails for too long — it dehydrates your nails which is usually the main cause of breakage." She adds that reckless removal of dip powder and gel or acrylic nails are another major causes of breakage and peeling.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_16-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"><a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=externalLink data-ordinal=1 rel=nofollow>Brittney Boyce</a>, a celebrity nail artist and founder of NAILS OF LA, says that nails with jagged edges are also more prone to getting snagged somewhere, which would cause tears and breakage. And lastly, she adds that wet nails are more prone to breakage as the water softens and bends them. (This is why we recommend getting <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=internalLink data-ordinal=2>waterless manicures</a>.)</p><span class=heading-toc id=toc-how-to-fix-a-broken-nail></span><h2 id=mntl-sc-block_18-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block instyle-sc-block-heading mntl-sc-block-heading"><span class=mntl-sc-block-heading__text>How to Fix a Broken Nail</span></h2><p id=mntl-sc-block_19-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">Thankfully, there's not just one way to fix a broken nail.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_21-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">Option one: Use dip powder. This is the best option for nails that have a true break vs. a small crack.</p><li>Begin by cleaning the affected nail with nail polish remover. Then, wait for it to dry.</li><li>Then, Choi says to apply nail glue to the broken area.</li><li>Dip the nail into the powder.

If anything, keep it nearby in case of a nail emergency.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_27-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">Option two: Use a tea bag. This approach works best for small cracks.</p><li>Take a dry, mesh tea bag and cut out a little square that'll cover the split. "This will serve as the bandage to the crack," explains Remark.</li><li>Clean the broken nail with nail polish remover and wait for it to dry.</li><li>Apply nail glue to the broken area.</li><li>While glue is still wet, apply the tea bag on top and allow the glue to soak through the tea bag.</li><li>Then, Choi recommends an extra layer of glue. "If you don't like harsh glue, use a top coat as an alternative for a temporary solution," she adds.</li><li>Once the glue (or top coat) is rock solid and dry, Remark says to file the affected edge and buff the glue area to make it blend seamlessly into the rest of the nail.</li><li>Finish by applying your favorite nail polish to conceal the tea bag.</li><p id=mntl-sc-block_31-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"><strong>VIDEO: So, What Exactly Is a Russian Manicure?</strong></p><span class=heading-toc id=toc-are-there-other-ways-to-conceal-a-broken-nail></span><h2 id=mntl-sc-block_35-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block instyle-sc-block-heading mntl-sc-block-heading"><span class=mntl-sc-block-heading__text>Are There Other Ways to Conceal a Broken Nail?</span></h2><p id=mntl-sc-block_36-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">Yes! Our three experts recommend using press-on nails in a pinch as they're easy to use and will provide a protective armor to keep your natural nails in place. "You just have to be extra careful when you're removing them," says Boyce, as taking them off carelessly could lead to a full break.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_38-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">If you have time to go to a salon, Remark says a manicurist can add a tip to the nail with resin, gel, or acrylic to restore length.</p><span class=heading-toc id=toc-how-to-prevent-breaking-your-nails></span><h2 id=mntl-sc-block_42-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block instyle-sc-block-heading mntl-sc-block-heading"><span class=mntl-sc-block-heading__text>How to Prevent Breaking Your Nails</span></h2><p id=mntl-sc-block_43-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">Strong, healthy nails will help prevent breakage. As with anything health-related, there's a process and a waiting period — but it's so worth it once you get there.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_45-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">Choi says that moisture is key to strong, healthy nails. As such, she recommends applying a cuticle oil, such as the JINsoon <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=externalLink data-ordinal=1>Honeysuckle + Primrose Cuticle Oil</a>, even on top of nail polish, gels, or fake nails. "Remember that oil penetrates the fastest, but even a hand lotion will work," she adds. Essentially, keep your hands and nails moisturized.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_47-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">She and Boyce also note the importance of a healthy diet so that you get all the necessary vitamins to grow strong nails.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_49-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">"If you have naturally weak or recently damaged nails the best thing you can do is not just 'let them breathe' — if they're weak or damaged, they need protection," says Remark. "Your best bet would be to use a strengthening polish." She suggests using <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=externalLink data-ordinal=1 rel=nofollow>essie's Hard To Resist</a> nail strengthener, which is what she uses in between gel manicures to keep her nails healthy.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7qrrSrbClnV6YvK57wZ6YrqypZLuitcusZqGnp2LBsHnFoq9mmV2Xv7C3xKdkp5mZoQ%3D%3D</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./how-suits-said-farewell-to-meghan-markle-in-season-7-finale-royal-wedding.html><span>←</span><span>How 'Suits' Said Farewell to Meghan Markle in Season 7 Finale Before Royal Wedding</span></a>
