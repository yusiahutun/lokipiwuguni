of her first six albums, she made the cunning, risky decision to re-record those albums to own their rights.</p><p class=align-left>It paid off, delighting ardent fans, bringing new Swifties into the fold, and earning her renewed respect within the industry.</p><p class=align-left>With "The Tortured Poets Department," she stands to make waves once more, although she'll face stiff competition from
