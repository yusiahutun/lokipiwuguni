Dental floss is also advised.</p><p class=dcr-1lpi6p1>Javier Botey of the Information Centre for Immigrant Workers denounced the guide, adding there were immigrants who came to Spain 'with better and cleaner habits than ours' who could 'give us advice'.</p><p class=dcr-1lpi6p1>The guide also explains how to dress: work clothes should be worn to work, along with work shoes, while pyjamas are used in bed, house shoes are for the house and trainers are most suitable for sporting activities. Taking up sports, of course, is 'a great way of filling your free time'.</p><p class=dcr-1lpi6p1>The authors do not seem to be familiar with the back-breaking work and squalid conditions faced by many thousands of illegal immigrants in southern Spain, especially those on the farms that provide fruit and vegetables to much of Europe.</p><p class=dcr-1lpi6p1>North Africans often find it impossible to rent decent housing because many Spaniards claim they will destroy property. Migrant workers are forced to share squalid shacks and derelict buildings without running water or electricity. Even so, they are dotted with buckets of hand-carried water where clothes lie soaking.</p><p class=dcr-1lpi6p1>The guide adds that immigrants should clean their lavatories every day and clean plates and cutlery in a dishwasher. Beds should be 'comfortable, with no dip in the middle, and with a mattress at least 18-20cm thick'.</p><p class=dcr-1lpi6p1>In real life, many workers are forced to share rudimentary beds, a slab of wood padded with cloth, and can only dream of a tap.</p><p class=dcr-1lpi6p1>'To us, this guide seems to show a terrible lack of respect,' says Toni Vigo of SOS Racism in Valencia.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tbTEoKyaqpSerq96wqikaK%2Bfp7mle5FpZ2pnmpa7cH2TaKuhnZ%2BXwKa%2B1Z6p</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./mimic-go-portable-alarm.html><span>←</span><span>The Mimic GO Is a Portable Alarm With Motion Detection</span></a>
