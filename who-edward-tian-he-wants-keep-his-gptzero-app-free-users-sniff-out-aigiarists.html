It was so successful that it crashed the app, requiring the online host Streamlit to step in to support a larger amount of web traffic.“There was so much hype and excitement surrounding ChatGPT, but like with any new technology, we have to adopt it responsibly”, said Tian, a 22-year-old Princeton University senior who is months away from his finals in computer science and journalism. “That was the main motivation for <a rel=nofollow class="euc41pk0 e13op9j60 e1qbu6wp1 css-jgjyn2 ef1hf1w0" href=# data-qa=BaseLink-renderAnchor-StyledAnchor><span data-qa=Component-Text class="css-0 e1qbu6wp0">GPTZero</span></a>.”<img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/cdn.i-scmp.com/sites/default/files/d8/images/canvas/2023/01/12/a7415bc1-5614-4f29-b5a5-be3c14e2770a_35bf73e1.jpg>ChatGPT was launched in November by OpenAI, a seven-year old AI research lab founded by its chief executive Sam Altman, who counts the world’s wealthiest man and <a class="euc41pk0 e13op9j60 e1qbu6wp1 css-jgjyn2 ef1hf1w0" href=# data-qa=BaseLink-renderAnchor-StyledAnchor><span data-qa=Component-Text class="css-0 e1qbu6wp0">Tesla</span></a> chief executive Elon Musk as an early backer.<p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">The bot can produce humanlike texts based on prompts, and can generate text in various formats, from long essays and fiction to lines of computer codes for specific tasks.</p><h3 type=h3 data-qa=Component-Component class="e14khtrb0 css-17x7qa9 e793b7w1"><a class="link-text css-e0dnmk ef1hf1w0" href=# data-qa=BaseLink-renderAnchor-StyledAnchor><p><span data-qa=DigitalArchiveLink-TitleText class="css-66qo9a eeeqn932">China’s internet users finding creative uses for ChatGPT</span></p></a></h3>Six days after its November 30 launch, ChatGPT garnered 1 million users. The bot is not officially available in mainland China or Hong Kong, driving many users to access it via <a class="euc41pk0 e13op9j60 e1qbu6wp1 css-jgjyn2 ef1hf1w0" href=# data-qa=BaseLink-renderAnchor-StyledAnchor><span data-qa=Component-Text class="css-0 e1qbu6wp0">virtual private networks</span></a> (VPNs).<p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">It is increasingly being used by students as the crutch for writing their assignments and essays, a practice dubbed “AIgiarism” that has teachers in many US schools up in arms.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">ChatGPT is the Pandora’s Box of social media technology, as it comes with pros and cons like any new technology, said Tian. “While it’s a brilliant innovation, there are also lots of downsides too.”</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/cdn.i-scmp.com/sites/default/files/d8/images/canvas/2023/01/12/348537c2-c42e-4956-8550-99f9d1a644e8_8a439a44.jpg><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">GPTZero uses two variables to identify if text shown to it is written by a bot or human: perplexity and burstiness. Perplexity is a measurement of the randomness in text. If a corpus of text is unfamiliar (perplexing) to the bot, then it is more likely to have been written by a human. If the text is familiar to the bot, then it is more likely to be generated by AI.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">As a stand-alone yardstick, perplexity is “imperfect”, so the assessment has to be augmented with burstiness, which compares variations of sentences, Tian said. Humans tend to write with variations in sentences: long rambling thoughts alongside short sentences, active voices next to passive ones. AI-written text tends to be uniform.</p>Tian was born in Tokyo, raised between Beijing and Toronto and now attends Princeton University, where he works as a <a rel=nofollow class="euc41pk0 e13op9j60 e1qbu6wp1 css-jgjyn2 ef1hf1w0" href=# data-qa=BaseLink-renderAnchor-StyledAnchor><span data-qa=Component-Text class="css-0 e1qbu6wp0">student reporter</span></a> for the university newspaper The Daily Princetonian. During his summer break, he was a software engineering intern at Microsoft.<p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">His parents, both software engineers, hail from Beijing. His grandmother, who he credits as being one of his biggest inspirations in life, was an electrical engineer who graduated from Tsinghua University. She helped raise Tian and his siblings and taught them Chinese from a young age.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">A love for learning was embedded into his childhood. He was interested in the intersection between computer science and journalism and how technology can be used to enhance and augment the art of multimedia storytelling in journalism.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">In his demonstration of GPTZero, Tian used a March 2015 essay in The New Yorker magazine by John McPhee as tribute to the American writer whose “transformative” writing class inspired Tian about the beauty of the written prose.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">“Being able to write, or write originally, will still remain an important skill, so [writers] will be even more valuable”, Tian said, adding that society will still have the inherent need for original prose even as AI gets better at generating text. “There is something implicitly beautiful in human writing.”</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tK%2FMqWWcp51kr7a%2FyKecrKtflr%2B1tcKlnGhrYmWDdoSQaK6hp12asbit0Z1kraGRo3qpsYywmKeso2K4prHPZp%2Biq12cvbXGxKumZpmgpXqnvsSeZK6rlafAbr%2FNop2fZZ%2BqwW6tyKCgmqqZqMG0</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./chloe-ting-youtuber.html><span>←</span><span>Chloe Ting [Youtuber]- Age,Videos , Boyfriend/Girfriend, Family, Videos, Hot Photos,Weight, Photos,</span></a>
