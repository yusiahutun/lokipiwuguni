Ervic Vijandre and Marian Rivera are both from Cavite. And both of them are La Sallista where Ervic graduated in La Salle Taft and Marian in La Salle Dasmariñas. They started out as schoolmates at St. Francis of Assisi School in Cavite. He was then in second year high school, while she was already in her third year when they became an item. Since then, Ervic has been close to Marian’s family. Even way back then, he would often go to her house that’s why he have already established closeness with her family. Interestingly, before Ervic became part of the Taguig Batang Global squad, he was a former member of the RP Youth baseball team and a member of the De La Salle University basketball Team-B and DLSU’s baseball team Green Batters during his college years. Ervic graduated from DLSU last October 2008 with a Bachelor of Arts in Philippine Studies degree, majoring in Filipino Mass Media. Marian, on the other hand, graduated with a Psychology degree from La Salle Dasmariñas. There were on-off in their relationship during those six years. In between those times was a brief and almost non-existent affair of Marian Rivera with StarStruck Mark Herras. Then news came that Marian being courted again by Ervic. The two were reportedly seen together in several events as of late especially during the holiday season of 2007. They were allegedly also seen at the Alabang Town Center to watch Marian’s movie, Desperadas. Marian keep mum about her lovelife even until they broke up in late 2008. Marian Rivera sets record straight on split with Ervic in early 2009. Marian Rivera tells the entertainment media that her ex-boyfriend of six years, Ervic Vijandre, was very jealous and controlling. According to media reports, Marian explained that he was jealous to Dingdong for sometime, but she assure him that there was nothing to get jealous about because it was purely work. “The truth is,” she continued, “My boyfriend was conservative and we argued about my acceptance for calendar 2009 of Ginebra San Miguel. Actually, the offer was already took a long time, and we did not accept it with my manager. But when they told me that I do not have to pose too sexy ... Yes, I wore a two-piece swimsuit, but with a t-shirt above, I said I will try. He won’t allow me [Ervic]. But I said, we should grab the opportunity.” “We have been arguing about it for two weeks. It’s not true that he wants me to choose between career and him. So we deeply talked about our realtionship and decided to break up, then after that I accepted the offer for the calendar.” Despite the breakup, the former lovers try to remain good friends.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7uLTOrJuarJWZxKm7jZympmeUlsGqusZopJqqmZa7br7Ir5yrmV2Wu6V5xKutoptdq7arrc2dqZ4%3D</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./sebastian-shakespeare-buff-bond-girl-hates-sex-scenes-gemma-arterton-strips-fans-html.html><span>←</span><span>Gemma Arterton strips off for her fans writes SEBASTIAN SHAKESPEARE</span></a>
