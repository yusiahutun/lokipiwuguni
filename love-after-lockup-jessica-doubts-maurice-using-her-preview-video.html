It hasn’t been easy for her with mailing letters, sending money over the phone, and more. Jessica has <a href=# data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>risked a lot for him</a>, but she’s thrilled that Maurice is finally getting out so they can start this next chapter.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/hollywoodlife.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/love-after-lockup-we-tv-embed-1.jpg><p id=content-paragraph-4>However, that doesn’t mean Jessica doesn’t have doubts about Maurice.&nbsp;“I know I’ve been the only woman since we’ve gotten married and everything, but he was talking to another girl before he actually asked me to marry him and she was sending him a lot of money and they never met in person,” Jessica says. “But I’m starting to have a few doubts. You have to be married to get conjugal visits, so maybe Maurice has been using me for these last 4.5 years for sex.”</p><p id=content-paragraph-5>She wonders, “What if he comes out and he’s a completely different man? And he doesn’t want to be with me.” While waiting for him, Jessica says she’s “nervous as f**k.” Suddenly, a van pulls up and Jessica hopes that Maurice is on that van.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/hollywoodlife.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/love-after-lockup-we-tv-embed-2.jpg><p id=content-paragraph-6>The synopsis for the July 24 episode of <a href=# data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>the show</a> reads: “Shawn’s confession leaves his daughter in tears.
