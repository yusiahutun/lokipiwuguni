Because they provide a perfect fit with limited irritation or chafing, as you might get from more prominent seams, many people would rather grab a pair of seamless leggings over anything else. While seamless leggings aren’t actually entirely seamless, they have fewer seams and are made from one piece of fabric rather than several stitched together. That way, they can be more flexible and comfortable as you go about your daily activities.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-1 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--instyle commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html">Since seamless leggings offer so many advantages, we looked into which styles are the best of the best — giving you a smooth look and comfy support that’s just as suited to lounging as it is to sweat it out in the gym. We spoke to a range of professional fashion stylists with first-hand experience of what makes good leggings great, and we rounded up our favorites that you can shop right now.</p><span class=heading-toc id=toc-best-overall-spanx-ecocare-high-waisted-seamless-leggings></span><p><h2><span class=product-record__superlative-text>Best Overall</span></h2></p><p><h3><span class=product-record__heading--text>Spanx EcoCare High-Waisted Seamless Leggings</span></h3></p><img width=1500 height=1000 data-sizes=750px alt="Spanx EcoCare High-Waisted Seamless Leggings" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center src="https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.instyle.com/thmb/AKK-iAROrWSO8z8nmUWBlsirbeI=/fit-in/1500x1000/filters:no_upscale():max_bytes(150000):strip_icc()/spanx-ecocare-high-waisted-seamless-leggings-e4e93494ff6d430897d2347981d10437.jpg"> <span class=figure-article-caption-owner><p>Spanx</p></span><p><strong>What We Love: </strong>They provide hold around the tummy and support for the legs, too.</p><p><strong>What We Don’t Love:</strong> They run a little small.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-2 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--instyle commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html">Spanx has upgraded their much-loved <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=externalLink data-ordinal=1 rel="sponsored nofollow noskim">Look at Me Now seamless leggings</a> by keeping the winning design and making them in a more planet-friendly fabric, the recycled Sensil EcoCare nylon. UK-based stylist <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=externalLink data-ordinal=2 rel="nofollow nocaes">Emma Lightbown</a> notes that these are “loved by loads of celebrities including <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=externalLink data-ordinal=3 rel=nocaes>Reese Witherspoon and Jennifer Garner</a>, and offer compression without feeling restrictive.” Meanwhile, personal stylist and fashion blogger <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=externalLink data-ordinal=4 rel=nocaes>Tara West</a> loves their ultra high-waisted cut for shaping your silhouette. They’re “designed to hit just below the bust for great coverage as the compression fabric smooths your waist and legs,” West says. “The seamless legging allows for an elegant look and unmatched comfort in any occasion.”</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-3 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--instyle commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html">These leggings are perfection if you like a little more hold around your tummy, and they don’t roll down at all, which is a huge plus. The compression also allows your legs to feel supported, meaning they’ll feel less worn out after a long day out and about. Though some people do find these run small, the inclusive range of sizes should hopefully help many different people achieve their perfect fit. Last but not least, if you’re on the market for a more traditional waistline, stylist and creative consultant <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=externalLink data-ordinal=1 rel="nofollow nocaes">Lauren Glazer</a> also loves the <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=externalLink data-ordinal=2 rel="sponsored nofollow noskim">slightly lower-waisted version</a> of these leggings.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-4 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--instyle commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html"><strong>Size: </strong>XS-3X | <strong>Length</strong>: Ankle |<strong> Colors: </strong>1 |<strong> Material: </strong>EcoCare nylon</p><span class=heading-toc id=toc-best-budget-boody-full-leggings></span><p><h2><span class=product-record__superlative-text>Best Budget</span></h2></p><p><h3><span class=product-record__heading--text>Boody Full Leggings</span></h3></p><img width=1500 height=1000 data-sizes=750px alt="Boody Full Leggings" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center src="https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.instyle.com/thmb/JSHKBVdBvF_kdzTd6iG4F8V8pc0=/fit-in/1500x1000/filters:no_upscale():max_bytes(150000):strip_icc()/boody-full-leggings-a0ef9050a02c431ba8436b7b031ab428.jpg"> <span class=figure-article-caption-owner><p>Boody</p></span><p><strong>What We Love: </strong>They’re sensitive skin-approved, and considerate to the planet.</p><p><strong>What We Don’t Love:</strong> They’re a little see-through, so aren’t the best for working out.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-7 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--instyle commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html">Not only are these leggings from Boody an affordable choice (you can also get a discount <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=externalLink data-ordinal=1 rel="nofollow nocaes">when you buy a two-pack</a>), but they’re also quite simply a great choice. Glazer loves that these are made from bamboo viscose, a fabric that’s kind to sensitive skin as well as contributing to these leggings’ overall eco-friendly credentials. On that note, Boody is a certified B Corporation and aims to reduce carbon emissions and energy expenditure throughout their production process — which is extra cool if you consider it’s a more wallet-friendly brand as well.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-8 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--instyle commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html">“The Boody seamless leggings are side seam-free,” explains Glazer, noting that they aren’t entirely seamless. “They actually have a waistband, which provides comfort and support and [helps them] stay up better than a fully seamless pair.” These are especially suited for you if you prefer a mid-rise waistband. While the brand claims you can wear these to the gym (and you surely can if you’re in a pinch), they are actually a bit see-through when you move, so we recommend reserving them for lounging, sleeping, or for wearing as a base layer when it gets cold outside — all roles they fulfill to perfection.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-9 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--instyle commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html"><strong>Size: </strong>XS-XL | <strong>Length</strong>: Full |<strong> Colors: </strong>1 |<strong> Material: </strong>Bamboo viscose, nylon, spandex</p><span class=heading-toc id=toc-best-splurge-athleta-aurora-seamless-tight></span><p><h2><span class=product-record__superlative-text>Best Splurge</span></h2></p><p><h3><span class=product-record__heading--text>Athleta Aurora Seamless Tight</span></h3></p><img width=1500 height=1000 data-sizes=750px alt="Aurora Seamless Tight" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center src="https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.instyle.com/thmb/rxClt8rdWZeoAmxpTrE5VB7fr3Q=/fit-in/1500x1000/filters:no_upscale():max_bytes(150000):strip_icc()/athleta-aurora-seamless-tight-d86ffb41c71f431b91d45d10e66dc7d8.jpg"> <span class=figure-article-caption-owner><p>Athleta</p></span><p><strong>What We Love: </strong>They’re made from ribbed, sweat-wicking, odor-reducing fabric.</p><p><strong>What We Don’t Love:</strong> They’re too thick for sweaty workouts.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-12 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--instyle commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html">Athleta is an InStyle fave for many reasons, starting with their inclusive sizing, which caters for sizes XXS through 3X. But of course inclusivity alone isn’t enough to completely sell us on a brand: We often turn to Athleta for well constructed, high quality workout gear and athleisure, and these full-length, high-waisted seamless leggings are absolutely living up to our expectations. Available in basic black as well as a selection of more unexpected colors (hello, Barbie pink!), these are lightly ribbed for a super cute look and added comfort. They’re also side seam-free to help minimize chafing, though they still have a seam on the inside leg.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-13 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--instyle commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html">While these are a little too thick and warm for high-intensity workouts, they’re just right for wearing to yoga, pilates or barre —&nbsp;or for lounging around of course. Also, they’re made from a super smart fabric blend that helps them not get smelly, wicks sweat, and allows your skin to breathe despite the leggings’ thickness. And if all of that wasn’t enough to convince you, maybe Athleta’s B Corp status will seal the deal: As such, they use recycled or eco-friendly materials where possible, and work to empower women across their supply chain.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-14 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--instyle commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html"><strong>Size: </strong>XXS-3X | <strong>Length</strong>: Full |<strong> Colors: </strong>4 |<strong> Material: </strong>Nylon, elastane</p><span class=heading-toc id=toc-best-plus-size-skims-soft-smoothing-legging></span><p><h2><span class=product-record__superlative-text>Best Plus-Size</span></h2></p><p><h3><span class=product-record__heading--text>Skims Soft Smoothing Legging</span></h3></p><img width=1500 height=1000 data-sizes=750px alt="Skims Soft Smoothing Legging" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center src="https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.instyle.com/thmb/Ye7qGM8phXHxCqWQjD3WlrlbYqI=/fit-in/1500x1000/filters:no_upscale():max_bytes(150000):strip_icc()/skims-soft-smoothing-legging-ccb32d33b18d4d4c8ccd7e6ed97dd034.jpg"> <span class=figure-article-caption-owner><p>Skims</p></span><p><strong>What We Love: </strong>They’re as soft and smoothing as their name suggests.</p><p><strong>What We Don’t Love:</strong> You may need to size up.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-17 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--instyle commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html">SKIMS is honestly such an amazing brand; we can only tip our hats to cofounders Kim Kardashian and Emma Grede. And we’re not the only ones who are impressed. Stylist and <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=externalLink data-ordinal=1 rel="nofollow nocaes">Fashivly</a> cofounder <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=externalLink data-ordinal=2 rel=nocaes>Ashlyn Greer</a> calls these seamless leggings a “great option for a workout or lounging with its softer compression and feel.” She’s also handing out bonus points for the brand’s inclusive sizing, with these leggings available in sizes XXS to 4X. Meanwhile, <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=externalLink data-ordinal=3 rel=nocaes>Gabriela Rosales</a>, a fashion stylist and founder of <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=externalLink data-ordinal=4 rel="nofollow nocaes">The Stylist Witch</a>, loves their wide, supportive waistband, and is partial to the very KiKi color options, too: from a beautiful deep brown to a cool gray.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-18 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--instyle commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html">With “soft” AND “smoothing” in their name, these leggings definitely had a lot of expectations to live up to, but reviewers say they totally manage it, offering a smoothed silhouette with more compression than you might expect. The fabric also feels super soft and comfortable for going about your day. One minor note: You may need to size up here because the compression means they can be harder to hike up if you get your regular size. But once you get the sizing right, expect to live your entire life in these —&nbsp;they’re really that good.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-19 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--instyle commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html"><strong>Size: </strong>XXS-4X | <strong>Length</strong>: Full |<strong> Colors: </strong>6 |<strong> Material: </strong>Nylon, spandex</p><span class=heading-toc id=toc-best-black-alo-yoga-seamless-cable-knit-high-waist-legging></span><p><h2><span class=product-record__superlative-text>Best Black</span></h2></p><p><h3><span class=product-record__heading--text>Alo Yoga Seamless Cable Knit High-waist Legging</span></h3></p><img width=1500 height=1000 data-sizes=750px alt="Alo Yoga Seamless Cable Knit High-waist Legging" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center src="https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.instyle.com/thmb/eBHn2niIx0SqcqoqMDuuMPJGwvY=/fit-in/1500x1000/filters:no_upscale():max_bytes(150000):strip_icc()/alo-yoga-seamless-cable-knit-high-waist-legging-ae9c13da027f49668e6a1cc5d3b01729.jpg"> <span class=figure-article-caption-owner><p>Alo Yoga</p></span><p><strong>What We Love: </strong>They’re perfect for channeling your inner model off-duty.</p><p><strong>What We Don’t Love:</strong> The sizing is far too exclusive.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-23 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--instyle commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html">Once you find a really good <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=internalLink data-ordinal=1>black legging</a>, you’re kind of set where athleisure is concerned —&nbsp;and this is one really good black legging if we ever saw one. It’s no wonder celebs including Bella Hadid, Hailey Bieber, and Camila Cabello are obsessed with Alo, and if you’re looking to channel your inner model-off-duty, these are it.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-24 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--instyle commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html">Made with a wide, stretchy waistband out of seamless, cable-knit fabric that’s super soft, they’re high-waisted and full-length, with a small white Alo logo in the back. They’re super flattering and ideal for taking you from yoga to brunch, but we’re pretty disappointed with the brand’s exclusive sizing, which clearly favors smaller bodies. As a small redemption, these are sized a little large, so many people can afford to size down if need be.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-25 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--instyle commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html"><strong>Size: </strong>XXS-L | <strong>Length</strong>: Full |<strong> Colors: </strong>1 |<strong> Material: </strong>Nylon, elastane</p><span class=heading-toc id=toc-best-high-waisted-alala-78-barre-seamless-tight></span><p><h2><span class=product-record__superlative-text>Best High-Waisted</span></h2></p><p><h3><span class=product-record__heading--text>Alala Seamless Tight</span></h3></p><img width=1500 height=1000 data-sizes=750px alt="Saks Fifth Avenue Alala 7/8 Barre Seamless Tight" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center src="https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.instyle.com/thmb/tjHxnSIdc6mhtOf3YniggE6-Z0I=/fit-in/1500x1000/filters:no_upscale():max_bytes(150000):strip_icc()/alala-78-barre-seamless-tight-d91e56848ac14bfdaac7f2c35fa631d3.jpg"> <span class=figure-article-caption-owner><p>Saks Fifth Avenue</p></span><p><strong>What We Love: </strong>They feel so soft and look so good.</p><p><strong>What We Don’t Love:</strong> They can slide down a little.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-29 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--instyle commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html">These days, a majority of leggings are high-waisted, because that’s many people’s preference in terms of comfort and look. We love these ones’ marriage of a high-waisted fit and 7/8 length, which is “great for those with shorter legs or those who prefer a crop,” as noted by Lightbown. We also appreciate the wide waistband and super cute ribbing on the side, as well as these pants’ butter-soft fabric, which feels so good to move around in.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-30 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--instyle commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html">These are specifically designed to wear for low-impact workouts such as barre or pilates, or for lounging, and come in either plain black or a sweet periwinkle. Lovers of these leggings say that they look so good on —&nbsp;shaping without restricting — and feel high-quality, and that they’re really stretchy and squat-proof too! The only snag is that they can slide down a little bit at times, which is definitely annoying, but not the end of the world.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-31 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--instyle commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html"><strong>Size: </strong>S-L | <strong>Length</strong>: 7/8 |<strong> Colors: </strong>2 |<strong> Material: </strong>Nylon, lycra</p><span class=heading-toc id=toc-best-compression-felina-womens-seychelle-rosette-seamless-legging></span><p><h2><span class=product-record__superlative-text>Best Compression</span></h2></p><p><h3><span class=product-record__heading--text>Felina Seychelle Rosette Seamless Legging</span></h3></p><img width=1500 height=1000 data-sizes=750px alt="Macy's Felina Women's Seychelle Rosette Seamless Legging" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center src="https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.instyle.com/thmb/O5hLPxVmWbBcLfrNClTEOW5NQLA=/fit-in/1500x1000/filters:no_upscale():max_bytes(150000):strip_icc()/felina-womens-seychelle-rosette-seamless-legging-b6ecf13261f94bd6a55850fd6f98de68.jpg"> <span class=figure-article-caption-owner><p>Macy's</p></span><p><strong>What We Love: </strong>They make a great dupe for our pick from Spanx.</p><p><strong>What We Don’t Love:</strong> They run small and don’t come in many sizes.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-34 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--instyle commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html">Lightbown loves these mid-range leggings’ design —&nbsp;especially the four-way stretch fabric that offers a great amount of comfort all while feeling supportive. The compression these give you is a huge selling point here as well, making them tight-fitting and shaping, all while feeling lightweight and breathable as you go about your workout or relax at home.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-35 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--instyle commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html">These also feature opaque fabric so you can squat as much as you please, plus that coveted wide waistband, and floral lace paneling for a touch of extra personality. They come in three lovely colors: a burnt rose, a creamy oatmeal, and a slate gray, though these leggings’ biggest fans wish there were more to choose from. They run small, too, which is a bit of a problem since the size range isn’t very wide.

They’re cleverly designed with a wide waistband, which provides tummy control and doesn’t roll down, plus a chafe-free gusseted crotch and a “scrunch” back which enhances your booty without looking over-the-top obvious. Also, their fabric features four-way stretch for ease of movement, on top of being sweat-wicking and providing just the right amount of compression to keep you feeling secure.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-40 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--instyle commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html">As with many items on Amazon, these come in an astonishing range of colors —&nbsp;we’re partial to the golf green, dandelion brown, and old rose, but you can’t really go wrong here. Also, you can get a three-pack for just $50, so if you love these when you try them, you can stock up on a ton of them for all your workout needs. Most people find they are thick enough to be squat-proof; in fact, their thickness is their one downfall, since they can feel a bit too warm. If that’s not a problem for you, these are pretty perfect!</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-41 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--instyle commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html"><strong>Size: </strong>XXS-XL | <strong>Length</strong>: 7/8 |<strong> Colors: </strong>38 |<strong> Material: </strong>Nylon, polyester, spandex</p><span class=heading-toc id=toc-best-for-running-gymshark-vital-seamless-20-leggings></span><p><h2><span class=product-record__superlative-text>Best for Running</span></h2></p><p><h3><span class=product-record__heading--text>Gymshark Vital Seamless 2.0 Leggings</span></h3></p><img width=1500 height=1000 data-sizes=750px alt="Gymshark Vital Seamless 2.0 Leggings" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center src="https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.instyle.com/thmb/aAvbIuzEGK0pd2y66U6maHAsI0w=/fit-in/1500x1000/filters:no_upscale():max_bytes(150000):strip_icc()/vital-seamless-20-leggings-8549b3f00f724d8a84b4180ce1ed9bd7.jpg"> <span class=figure-article-caption-owner><p>Gymshark</p></span><p><strong>What We Love: </strong>They’ll make you forget you’re even wearing leggings (in a good way).</p><p><strong>What We Don’t Love:</strong> We wish they came in more sizes.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-44 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--instyle commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html">With thousands of five-star reviews and <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=internalLink data-ordinal=1>longtime devotees at InStyle</a>, Gymshark’s seamless leggings are some of the best in the biz. These are available in 11 gorgeous colors, from basic black to popping fuchsia marl, and Lightbown calls them “my personal go-to for leggings.” She says, “These are affordable, wash well, and retain their color and shape. They offer moisture-wicking, are squat-proof, and don’t roll down.”</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-45 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--instyle commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html">These leggings also feature marl dots, which are designed to allow your skin to breathe even at its sweatiest, as well as “contour” your legs to make them really pop. These are very well suited to gym workouts and running since they’re designed to minimize sweating and make you forget you’re even wearing leggings (in a good way, not in a nightmare-come-true way, in case that was unclear) — they will stay up and keep you cool throughout. We just wish they came in more sizes.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-46 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--instyle commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html"><strong>Size: </strong>XS-XXL | <strong>Length</strong>: Ankle |<strong> Colors: </strong>11 |<strong> Material: </strong>Nylon, elastane</p><span class=heading-toc id=toc-best-for-working-out-set-active-sculptflex-leggings></span><p><h2><span class=product-record__superlative-text>Best for Working Out</span></h2></p><p><h3><span class=product-record__heading--text>Set Active Sculptflex Leggings</span></h3></p><img width=1500 height=1000 data-sizes=750px alt="Set Active Sculptflex Leggings" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center src="https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.instyle.com/thmb/1QZSdh-c9c69XIHW7otsFcCU2B0=/fit-in/1500x1000/filters:no_upscale():max_bytes(150000):strip_icc()/set-active-sculptflex-leggings-08441bd61bb3446a9645436e7ebb514a.jpg"> <span class=figure-article-caption-owner><p>Set Active</p></span><p><strong>What We Love: </strong>They offer compression in all the right places, and don’t roll down.</p><p><strong>What We Don’t Love:</strong> You may need to size up for a better fit.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-49 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--instyle commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html">Your sweaty gym workouts need leggings that are squat-proof, stretchy, and supportive, which is precisely why Set made these seamless leggings out of their proprietary Sculptflex fabric. This blend offers exactly the right amount of compression to flatter your figure (sculpt) while allowing you the flexibility to move freely (flex). They’re really soft, too, but just note that the compression may mean you need to size up for them to fit.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-50 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--instyle commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html">“There are so many things to love about this pair from Set Active,” says Greer. “Great color options, lots of different matching tops to pair with, and they're a top pick for the perfect blend of comfort and compression.” She’s right: The limited edition colorways are so beautiful, including the flamingo pink, mojito green, and glitz lavender. Meanwhile, Rosales also points to the wide waistband and high-quality fabric as definite advantages to this particular pair. Oh, and did we mention they don’t roll down? That’s right —&nbsp;instead, they mold effortlessly to your body as you move.

Speaking of workouts, these are perfect for yoga and pilates, but also for strength sessions (including squatting, of course, since they’re actually pretty thick). They’re also super comfy for lounging around on your rest days, though. Sadly, the little logo on the waistband doesn’t stand up well to the washing machine, but we can probably let this one slide this time around.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-56 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--instyle commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html"><strong>Size: </strong>XS-L | <strong>Length</strong>: 7/8 |<strong> Colors: </strong>7 |<strong> Material: </strong>Nylon, spandex</p><span class=heading-toc id=toc-best-maternity-girlfriend-collective-black-seamless-maternity-legging></span><p><h2><span class=product-record__superlative-text>Best Maternity</span></h2></p><p><h3><span class=product-record__heading--text>Girlfriend Collective Seamless Maternity Legging</span></h3></p><img width=1500 height=1000 data-sizes=750px alt="Girlfriend Collective Black Seamless Maternity Legging" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center src="https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.instyle.com/thmb/nnKIR7Tu_PIrb_apQjmG83XOhrg=/fit-in/1500x1000/filters:no_upscale():max_bytes(150000):strip_icc()/girlfriend-collective-black-seamless-maternity-legging-85316259be454f568eed274c8d9bb9dc.jpg"> <span class=figure-article-caption-owner><p>Girlfriend Collective</p></span><p><strong>What We Love: </strong>They’re made from 83 percent nylon recycled from fishing nets.</p><p><strong>What We Don’t Love:</strong> They pill after just a few wears.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-60 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--instyle commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html">Girlfriend Collective is another of our favorite brands, thanks to their commitment to inclusivity, as well as planet- and people-friendly production practices. These maternity leggings come in up to a 6XL, and are made from 83 percent nylon recycled from fishing nets (the rest is stretchy spandex to accommodate your growing bump). A portion of proceeds also benefits Healthy Seas, so it’s a purchase you can feel really good about.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-61 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--instyle commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html">Anyway, as mentioned, these are super stretchy to provide you with the space and comfort you need to navigate your pregnancy with ease. They’re also lightweight, moisture-wicking, and breathable, so they’re just as great for fitting in a nap as they are for that prenatal pilates class you’ve been meaning to try. We also love that these are available in two lengths to suit every preference, plus five pretty colors. Unfortunately, these have a sneaky tendency to pill after just a few wears, which is disappointing — though not a deal-breaker.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-62 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--instyle commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html"><strong>Size: </strong>XXS-6XL | <strong>Length</strong>: Full or Cropped |<strong> Colors: </strong>5 |<strong> Material: </strong>Recycled nylon, spandex</p><span class=heading-toc id=toc-what-to-keep-in-mind></span><h2 id=mntl-sc-block_3-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-heading--instyle commerce-sc-block-heading--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-heading mntl-sc-block-heading"><span class=mntl-sc-block-heading__text>What to Keep in Mind</span></h2><h3 id=mntl-sc-block_3-0-1 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-subheading--instyle commerce-sc-block-subheading--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-subheading mntl-sc-block-subheading"><span class=mntl-sc-block-subheading__text>Length</span></h3><p id=mntl-sc-block_3-0-2 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--instyle commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html">Leggings come in a few different lengths, so it’s best to have some idea of what length you like best. “Leggings are available in various lengths, such as full-length, capri, or ankle-length,” says Lightbown. “Choose a length that suits your comfort and the purpose for which you'll be wearing them.” But if you have no idea what length to opt for, West offers this insight. “I suggest an ankle-length legging, as they will make you look chic and confident with any style shoe,” she says.</p><h3 id=mntl-sc-block_3-0-3 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-subheading--instyle commerce-sc-block-subheading--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-subheading mntl-sc-block-subheading"><span class=mntl-sc-block-subheading__text>Compression</span></h3><p id=mntl-sc-block_3-0-4 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--instyle commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html">When choosing seamless leggings, it’s important to decide how much compression you’re looking for, depending on what you’re planning to use yours for. “Some leggings offer a high level of compression, which can provide support and help with muscle recovery during workouts,” Lightbown says. “Others may have a lighter compression for everyday wear.
