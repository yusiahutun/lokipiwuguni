This was when he sent his condolences to the families of politicians Joyce Laboso and Ken Okoth who succumbed to the illness. Nevertheless, he did not share which type of cancer he had. His exact words were:</p>"Am so grateful to God for having seen me through a difficult battle with cancer last year. My heart goes out to the families of all who have Lost their loved ones to the scourge. We are praying for God’s strength in your hour of grief. May God comfort the family of Gov. Laboso. And May God comfort the family of Hon. Ken Okoth. We are praying for you for God’s grace in your hour of grief.”<p class=align-left>Last week, Rev Kathy Kiuna shared with her fans on Instagram concerning the most challenging journey of her life. In the post, Kathy announced that her husband Allan was diagnosed with cancer in 2018.</p><a class=c-article-read-also__image-wrapper href=#><img sizes=256px style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/netstorage-tuko.akamaized.net/images/29f7f60421339144.jpg></a><a class=c-article-read-also__headline href=# readability=27><p class=c-article-read-also__caption>Read also</p><p class=c-article-read-also__headline-wrapper><span class=c-article-read-also__headline-hover-inner>What happened to Mike Tyson's daughter?

Because of the treatment, Allan became weak, lost his hair, gained weight, and was incapable of standing or walking for long. Due to this, Pastor Kiuna could not perform any of his responsibilities in the church.</p><h2>Rev Kathy Kiuna steps in for her husband</h2><p class=align-left>While Allan was away getting treatment, Rev Kathy Kiuna had to step in as the head of the church. According to Kathy, it was quite tough to stand and address the congregation instead of being with her ailing spouse. Reverend Kathy further clarified that most of the topics she preached in 2018 were to strengthen her during that difficult moment. She believes that the Almighty was using her to assist others that were going through the same or worse.</p><p class=align-left>Despite how Rev Kathy felt, she had to be strong and show Allan that God's faithfulness would heal him.</p><a class=c-article-read-also__image-wrapper href=#><img sizes=256px style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/netstorage-tuko.akamaized.net/images/df5da3eff58cdff7.jpg></a><a class=c-article-read-also__headline href=# readability=27><p class=c-article-read-also__caption>Read also</p><p class=c-article-read-also__headline-wrapper><span class=c-article-read-also__headline-hover-inner>Melissa Lynn Henning-Camp: The heart-breaking story of Jeremy Camp's first wife</span></p></a><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/netstorage-tuko.akamaized.net/images/da09c97c6316cf86.jpg><h2>Allan Kiuna recovery</h2><p class=align-left>Towards the end of the long Instagram post, Kathy expressed that Bishop Kiuna was feeling much better and is doing well physically. She even posted various images showing the bishop's transition from when he was weak and losing hair to how he looks presently.</p><p class=align-left>According to the post, Kathy explains that the first and second images were taken when Allan was undergoing chemotherapy. The third picture was taken when the bishop was released from the hospital. In the fourth picture, one can see the bishop in his church preaching, although he was wearing a hat and could not stand for long. The last picture showed a healthier bishop Kiuna in action during the 40 Days of Glory campaign organized by the church.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/netstorage-tuko.akamaized.net/images/29f7f60421339144.jpg><p class=align-left>According to Kathy, Bishop Kiuna's hair has started to grow back; he is physically fit, can run, jump, and stand for hours. The reverend believes that with God, all things are possible, and she could not be happier.
