It’s a fun treat that makes more than your feet feel beautiful. Recently, though, a new kind of pedicure has been getting attention. Medical pedicures are a type of pedicure that focus on foot health. So, should you swap your regular pedi for a medi-pedi? Read on to learn more about medical pedicures and whether they’re right for you. &nbsp;</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading>What is a medical pedicure?</h2><p>Admittedly, “medical pedicure” does not sound fun. It reads cold, clinical, and void of the self-care connotations a <a href=#>traditional pedicure</a> calls to mind. Better perhaps, is its abbreviated version — “medi-pedi” — which sounds a little more fun. Marcela Correa, a medical pedicurist at <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">Medi-Pedi NYC</a>, <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">defines medi-pedis</a> as “the bridge between podiatry and nail care.” Where a regular pedicure is typically one-size-fits-all, medical pedicures are tailored to specific foot issues, and they don’t involve soaking the feet. Equipment is sterilized, which <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">isn’t always the case at salons</a>, and appointments take place at a podiatrist’s office or studio specializing in medical pedicures. Most appointments last 45 minutes to an hour and may include any of the following:</p><p class=inline-stn-player></p><ul><li>Assessment of the feet and toenails, pointing out specific issues to be addressed</li><li>Cleaning of feet and toenails</li><li>Buffing and shaping toenails</li><li>Removal of dead skin</li><li>Removal of imperfections like blisters, calluses, and ingrown toenails</li><li>Smoothing the heels</li></ul><p>You’ll leave a medical pedicure with smoother, cleaner feet. If you experience foot pain, this pedicure may alleviate it.</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading>Why should you get one?</h2><p>Medical pedicures aren’t solely (pun intended) about making feet beautiful, but they do leave the <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">feet feeling and looking refreshed</a>. They are particularly well-suited for those with toenail fungus, ingrown toenails, athlete’s foot, calluses, nail discoloration, and other common foot problems. If you walk a lot, a medical pedicure may provide relief from resulting aches and pains. Medi-Pedi NYC says the procedure can also be<a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener"> beneficial</a> for those with diabetes or arthritis, as well as runners, people who are on their feet all day for work, and women who frequently wear high heels.</p><p><strong>Related: <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">New Pedicure Trend Leaves Out *This* Key Ingredient: Nail Pros Reveal Why That’s a Good Thing</a></strong></p><h2 class=wp-block-heading>How much does a medical pedicure cost?</h2><p>Medical pedicures can cost up to $200. If you’ve been experiencing foot pain or feel self-conscious about the condition of your feet, this might be a worthwhile splurge. Check, too, with your insurance to see if the procedure is partially or fully covered, which is a possibility if it’s conducted in a medical facility.</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading>How often should I get a medical pedicure?</h2><p>Correa recommends patients get a medi-pedi <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">every six to eight weeks</a>. However, even a single medical pedicure could yield tangible results. While it’s easy enough to paint your nails at home, there’s no way to replicate a medical pedicure and all of its attendant equipment and expertise. If your feet are looking and feeling less than stellar and you want to give them a boost before sandal season, a medical pedicure could be a smart choice.&nbsp;</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7p7XRrKufp6KsvK6xzWeaqKVfpby0wNJon56ZnKm1cLnEnaCcmZxivaawyJysq50%3D</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./rodney-atkins-lung-infection.html><span>←</span><span>Rodney Atkins' Lung Infection Is Worse Than He'd Hoped</span></a>
