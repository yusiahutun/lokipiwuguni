She shared,&nbsp;</p><span class="ezoic-autoinsert-ad ezoic-long_content"></span><p>When you cut your face, you still aren't dealing with the issue that caused the desire for plastic surgery. You'll still have that. For me, I would rather deal with the first thing — the insecurity or the self-consciousness.</p><p>For all we know, one can do whatever they want to their body as long as it keeps them happy and healthy but exposing someone to rumors about something inevitable as aging is a path that we hope no one likely walks on.&nbsp;</p><p>Moreover, the whole journey hasn't really been easy for the actress.
