Initially, <strong><a href=#>UFC </a></strong>fans were pushing fr Conor McGregor to make his return in this historical fixture. But president <strong>Dana White</strong> still wasn't ready to lock it up for the fans. According to recent reports, both McGrgor and Chandler have been talking about the deal being finalized for June but we still haven't heard a peep from Dana. That may change tomorrow, when all the UFC 300 fighters get to do the first face-offs before Friday's weigh-ins. According to <strong>MMA Uncensored</strong>, they believe White will make a major announcement on Thursday and we may even get some action on stage.</p><figure class="ue-c-article__media ue-c-article__media--video" readability=1><p><span class=ue-c-article__media-description>Dana White teases Conor McGregor UFC return in cryptic video</span></p></figure><h2 class=ue-c-article__subheadline>McGregor and Chandler could be at Thursday's UFC 300 presser</h2><p>According to the report, both <strong>Conor McGregor and Michael Chandler </strong>are expected to be at the press conference for UFC 300. MMA Uncensored reported on their official X account that Dana white will announce their fight for June. They also claim that Conor and Chandler might be on stage to get a much awaited faceoff. If this happens, it will mean that <strong>UFC 300</strong> will kick off with a great start. Conor Mcgregor has been waiting to return to the octagon for a few years now. The injury he suffered was very serious but he has been recovered from that for at least a full year. MMA Uncensored are currently one of a few outlets reporting this, which makes it feel sketchy.</p><p>Michael Chandler has also been expecting a little too long and even got a little desperate when he has spoken to the press. All he cares about is getting into that octagon with Conor McGregor since he called him out after beating <strong>Tony Ferguson. </strong><strong>UFC </strong>fans are crossing their fingers for this to be true, we all want for Dana White to finally make the announcement and hope for June to get here as quicly as possible. Who woul dwin in a fight between <strong>Michael Chandler and Conor McGregor?</strong></p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7rq3RnJhnm5%2BifKa6jq6dnGdiZX91e49tZmpoX2uDcoOPaW%2BaamJrfXKwmG1onHCSaYJ5sY2hq6ak</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./20-astonishing-facts-about-stu-cook.html><span>←</span><span>20 Astonishing Facts About Stu Cook</span></a>
