"You ate off those boobs for a good year and a half."</p><p>Waiting for your permission to load the Instagram Media.</p><p>Padma jokingly captioned the video, "Littlehands: 'cover your boobs' Also Littlehands: *zooms in on boobs*."</p><p>Though the majority of her followers laughed alongside Lakshmi and her daughter in the comments, a few fans criticized the mother-daughter interaction.</p><p>"As a mom of 4 daughters, there's a time and a place and when it starts making our daughters uncomfortable because we are being objectified, time to take notice," one user wrote.</p><a class="article-block__link js-track-link" href=# data-node-ref=toofab:article:9b728d67-eb93-49b1-8f30-0764cb282e8f data-container-ref=toofab:article:8d23d6e3-71ea-4601-9cec-40b5a83efced data-context='{"section":"article-block","name":"article"}' readability=27><img src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/images.toofab.com/image/8a/5by4/2022/06/10/8aef3dfb60794c94be7ab9def832a520_xs.jpg width=300 height=240 style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center> <span class="media-credit article-block__media-credit">YouTube / First We Feast</span><p><h4 class="article-block__card-title article-block__card-title--has-credit">10 Celebrities Who Knew How to Handle the Heat on Hot Ones</h4><span class=article-block__cta-text>View Story</span></p></a><p>In an effort to defend herself, the food writer clapped back at the fan and replied, "First [of] all it's a JOKE. And my daughter isn’t uncomfortable with me or my boobs or my posts, nor does she read these comments unless I show her because she isn't on social media."</p><p>"It's really not that serious folks," she added before noting that her daughter was inactive on social media because "she has her studies to attend to."</p><p>This isn't the first time Lakshmi's called out her followers for making suggestions about her body. Back in December 2022, the "Tomatoes for Neela" author used a viral TikTok filter that made her appear as if she was drifting in a candlelit boat in a video to slam another fan comment on her breasts.</p><p>"On my way to put on a bra because user75929 told me to," she wrote in block text on the video.</p><a id=gallery-link-e5625fdd-2878-416d-bd0b-e2ec666ac070 class="media-link gallery-block__link js-track-link js-click-gallery" href=# data-node-ref=toofab:gallery:e5625fdd-2878-416d-bd0b-e2ec666ac070 data-context='{"name":"gallery-block","section":"permalink"}' data-container-ref=toofab:article:8d23d6e3-71ea-4601-9cec-40b5a83efced data-gallery-layout=carousel><img src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/images.toofab.com/image/d6/4by3/2023/12/21/d6b882ed24d048c4ba81fe4d1a66e4e9_md.jpg width=825 height=618 style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center></a><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmisn6Szoq6NnKamZ2Jlf3R7j2pmaW1fpa6lucBmo5qjo526qnnFmqVmmp%2Bkr7R5zJqbnmWUlsKotNOeqWatnpi8rrLOq6uampyafA%3D%3D</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./marca-motor.html><span>←</span><span>MARCA MOTOR</span></a>
