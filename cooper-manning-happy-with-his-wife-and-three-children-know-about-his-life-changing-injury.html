The future boyfriend and girlfriend were not so close during their childhood days but soon started to get in touch <span>as they grew&nbsp;older.&nbsp;</span>And now it's been nearly two-decade since they got married. Ellen started working as a lawyer based in Louisiana, New Orleans.&nbsp;</p><p>We must say they are a really lucky couple as they have known each other since childhood. When they were young, they might not have thought they would marry one day. And now, it has been a decade since they got married to each other, and the good thing is there are no signs of conflicts and divorce.</p><p>Cooper and his wife Ellen have three children: a daughter, <strong>May,</strong> born in 2002, and two sons,<strong>Arch,</strong>&nbsp;born in 2004, and <strong>Heid,</strong>&nbsp;born in 2006.&nbsp;</p><span id=ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-911 data-method=placement-service></span><p>His son Arch is named after Cooper's father, Archie Manning.

He was getting better day by day. His brother Peyton mentioned that he was a fantastic player and told Sports Illustrated that</p><p>Even when he was covered, you could always loft it up high and he’d catch it. No defensive back could stop him – he was taller than they were and he could leap well. This creates a perfect comfort zone for the quarterback. Hey, you think, Cooper’s either going to catch the ball or make sure it’s incomplete.</p><p>Also Read:&nbsp;<a href=#>Jordan Hinson is Single or Married? Is she Dating?

His dream then shattered. He started playing football when he was in fifth grade.&nbsp;</p><span id=ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-913 data-method=placement-service></span><p>He mentioned that</p><p>It changes your whole world. I’d played organized football since fifth grade. And here I was at school, making friends, living in an athletic dorm, and all of a sudden, they tell you you can’t do that anymore. I had to struggle with it for a while. Yeah, I guess I played my entire career a hit away from the wheelchair; thank God I was kind of a wuss and ran out of bounds so many times.</p><p>He went through different surgeries and rehabs. We must say that Cooper is a brave man who doesn't give up. He later joined Fox NFL Kickoff back in 2015 and started his own weekly segment, " ."
