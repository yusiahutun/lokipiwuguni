He deserves to be in Formula One. The confidence is there. He’s not making mistakes and he has the car – this is a very important combination.”</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">A member of the Alfa Romeo F1 set-up since 2020, Kubica acknowledged that the team had had its fair share of car troubles this year, but believes it is now in a stronger position than many of their F1 counterparts – especially in dealing with the issue of porpoising, or the bouncing of cars as a result of new F1 regulations.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">“Of course we have faced, as all teams have in this modern Formula One, the issue of porpoising,” he said. “But what we can build on is performance. We have to keep developing and we have to keep working on the car from a reliability point of view, but also from a performance point of view.”</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">Kubica believes the new regulations have given designers and engineers significant room to implement sweeping innovations in 2022.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/cdn.i-scmp.com/sites/default/files/d8/images/canvas/2022/07/28/82849eb9-5166-4d00-8ea4-261855de5a60_5785c80f.jpg><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">“I would say the development during this year is huge,” he said. “F1 is a very dynamic sport, not only on the circuit over the Grand Prix weekends, but especially in the factory.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">“The real race in F1 is won over days and nights in the factory perfecting your car.”</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">But there is still the issue of securing points, something that has largely evaded team Alfa Romeo, and in particular, Zhou in 2022.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">“For sure it is never nice to lose points, but overall I think the car’s performance is giving a big boost to the morale and atmosphere of the team,” Kubica said.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">“I said in Barcelona that Zhou’s season would depend a lot on how our car is behaving. Yes, you can have a fast car, but if the car has a very narrow operating window – especially for a rookie driver – it can be very difficult.”</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">In 2006, Kubica became the first Polish driver to sign with an F1 team and said he understood the significance of being a pioneer for the sport, in Zhou’s case that comes in a far bigger market.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">“He’s the first Chinese driver to join F1, so the attention is huge,” Kubica said. “Unfortunately we were not going to China because of Covid and pandemic situation, but I would expect a huge attendance when we go back there,” he said.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">“Having a national driver is something special.”</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tK%2FMqWWcp51kwLG70a1mn6eiosKtrYxqZpqqpJ6wrbGObGhxbmlngnCyzqukrqSRYn5uwsStnKuZnmKurbLAZqmopZWkeqW%2ByK%2Bcq2WipK%2BmvtNmoq6amZiubr%2FAsqpmspikwm6z1Jqlsq0%3D</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./10-captivating-facts-about-lee-janzen.html><span>←</span><span>10 Captivating Facts About Lee Janzen</span></a>
