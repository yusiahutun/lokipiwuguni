The uber-glamorous owner and creative director of <a class="euc41pk0 e13op9j60 e1qbu6wp1 css-jgjyn2 ef1hf1w0" href=# data-qa=BaseLink-renderAnchor-StyledAnchor><span data-qa=Component-Text class="css-0 e1qbu6wp0">luxury jewellery brand Stéfère</span></a>, whose client list reads like a roll-call of the rich and famous, had little more than one month to find a home to buy and furnish.<p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">“We opened [the Stéfère] office in Hong Kong eight years ago, but as we were travelling back and forth between here and Geneva, we lived in an apartment in The Peninsula hotel until the summer of 2018,” she recalls via a Zoom call from her villa on Mykonos, Greece, where she is working on a renovation project as well as designing jewellery. “At that point, we decided to move here more permanently but it all depended on whether my son, Alexandre, got into the school of his choice. If he wasn’t accepted, we weren’t going to stay.”</p>The now 14-year-old came up trumps but the race was on to find the family a home before they left for the summer. Larpin and her Swiss-Italian husband, Christian, a real-estate investor, looked at two properties, settling on a 2,700 sq ft, three-bedroom, four-bathroom apartment in The Lily, the curvaceous, flower-shaped building that late billionaire <a class="euc41pk0 e13op9j60 e1qbu6wp1 css-jgjyn2 ef1hf1w0" href=# data-qa=BaseLink-renderAnchor-StyledAnchor><span data-qa=Component-Text class="css-0 e1qbu6wp0">Nina Wang Kung Yu-sum</span></a> commissioned <a class="euc41pk0 e13op9j60 e1qbu6wp1 css-jgjyn2 ef1hf1w0" href=# data-qa=BaseLink-renderAnchor-StyledAnchor><span data-qa=Component-Text class="css-0 e1qbu6wp0">British architect Norman Foster</span></a> to design.<p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">It has jaw-dropping 180-degree views over Repulse Bay on one side, and Tai Tam Country Park on the other. Fortunately, the flat had never been lived in and there was no need to revamp the interiors – apart from staining the floor black to create a strong impression without detracting from the family’s art.</p><h3 type=h3 data-qa=Component-Component class="e14khtrb0 css-17x7qa9 e793b7w1"><a class="link-text css-e0dnmk ef1hf1w0" href=# data-qa=BaseLink-renderAnchor-StyledAnchor><p><span data-qa=DigitalArchiveLink-TitleText class="css-66qo9a eeeqn932">Inside hotel designer Bill Bensley’s exotic Bangkok home</span></p></a></h3><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">“We decorated the apartment ourselves because we wanted to put our own style on our home rather than letting someone choose for us. I am not an interior designer but I just follow my artistic instincts,” says Larpin. “My husband is a natural at interior design so it’s quite easy to decorate a home when he’s around.”</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">The apartment’s style revolves around the Larpins’ modern art collection. Bold, vivid, statement-making pieces adorn almost every wall and draw the eye away from the stunning scenery outside the angled picture windows. Many of the pieces are by artists who are also friends.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">“My art frames my home; it is chic, contemporary and comfortable,” says Larpin, who was born and raised in Romania during the communist era. “I put a higher priority on art than furniture. Since it is very colourful, the furniture needed to be clean and plain. As long as the furniture was in harmony with the art, it was fine.”</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">It also needed to be sufficiently understated so as not to compete with the Larpins’ eclectic collection of skulls, which infuse the flat with an edgy vibe. There are jewel-encrusted skulls in the powder room and on Larpin’s desk. Silver skull-shaped tables flank the master bed; rictus grins smile from windowsills and headboards.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">“I love skulls and Christian is almost more crazy about them than I am,” she says. “My personal style always influences both my home and my jewellery brand so there’s always an overlap. If you look around my home, you can see all my favourite things like the skulls and you also find them in my jewellery line, such as a pair of skull earrings that Lady Gaga wore.”</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">Larpin says her hectic travel schedule, pre-pandemic, means her home needs to be family-oriented, serene, comfortable and offer design inspiration.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">“We own many well-decorated vacation houses in Vietnam, Thailand and Greece, where I feel 100 per cent at home, but this apartment is different from all of them and it is my favourite place. It is special.”</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/cdn.i-scmp.com/sites/default/files/d8/images/methode/2020/09/15/258ce43e-eea0-11ea-8288-5c49f42eee5c_972x_113025.jpg><strong data-qa=ContentSchemaRender-defaultRenderMapFunctions-Component-0 class="css-1mniedq eq9i94316">Living room entrance</strong> At one end of the living area, near the front entrance, is a painting by French artist <a rel=nofollow class="euc41pk0 e13op9j60 e1qbu6wp1 css-jgjyn2 ef1hf1w0" href=# data-qa=BaseLink-renderAnchor-StyledAnchor><span data-qa=Component-Text class="css-0 e1qbu6wp0">Yves Clerc</span></a> and a black sculpture by Hsu Tung-lung.
