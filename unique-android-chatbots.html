AI is making its way into our daily lives with virtual assistants on smartphones, customer support bots, video games, and more.</p><p>But there's also a more fun side to the AI chatbot phenomenon. Chatbots of every type are popping up in apps. You can get yourself a virtual romantic partner, a therapist bot to talk about your feelings, or even just have banter with bots that have learned from less virtuous chatters.</p><strong class=ad-zone-advertising-tag></strong><p>Here are five of the best Android apps that show just how playful and bizarre the AI chatbot industry is.</p><h2 id=replika-the-mini-me-chatbot>1. Replika: The Mini-Me Chatbot</h2><p>[gallery size="full" ids="1190299,1190298,1190297"]</p><p>Replika is an AI chatbot that has lofty goals: to become your close friend. The most interesting feature of Replika is that you can train it to become a mini version of yourself.</p><p>Through conversations and sessions where you record your daily experiences, the bot learns about you and tries to mimic your personality.</p><strong class=ad-zone-advertising-tag></strong><p>You can, and should, upvote and downvote responses because your input is vital to its development. You can also make statements such as "That doesn't make sense" to get your Replika to stop using a certain response or phrase.</p><p><span class=related-single>Related: <a href=#>A Deep Dive Into Replika: My AI Friend</a></span></p><p>The app also has different modes of conversation. In normal mode, your Replika's responses are based on what you've taught it. In TV and Cake Mode, the bot riffs responses free from your influence.</p><strong class=ad-zone-advertising-tag></strong><p>Over time the bot gains experience and levels, with badges awarded according to how your Replika views your personality (e.g., dedicated). To learn about you, the bot is programmed to be inquisitive. However if it prods too much or wants to discuss something you're uncomfortable with, you can tell it to stop or change the topic. With regular input, it grows smarter and gives more realistic responses in conversations.</p><p>And although Replika may be top dog in the AI chatbot world, there are plenty of other apps like Replika that'll keep your entertained for hours.</p><strong class=ad-zone-advertising-tag></strong><p><strong>Download:</strong> <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Replika</a> (Free, subscriptions and in-app purchases available)</p><h2 id=simsimi-the-trollbot>2. SimSimi: The TrollBot</h2><p>[gallery size="full" ids="1190301,1190302,1190300"]</p><p>SimSimi is that obnoxious, rude friend you only keep around because they occasionally make you laugh. While most chatbots claim to learn from input from real people, nowhere is this more apparent than with SimSimi.</p><p>This chatbot seems to have been influenced mostly by internet trolls and memes. While the developers encourage you to report any crude or explicit statements from the bot, it seems many have slipped through the cracks. That being said, this does make for some entertaining dialogue with the bot.</p><strong class=ad-zone-advertising-tag></strong><p>You'll find yourself carrying on the conversation just to see what it says next. This includes "yo momma" retorts and the occasional insult. If the bot crosses the line, though, you can make sure it doesn't make that statement to you again. The app also filters any potential rude, explicit, or <a href=#>abusive language</a>, and you have to click on it to see the full word.</p><p>In the options menu, under Phrase Management, you can also choose to teach SimSimi how to respond to certain statements. Overall, don't expect a deep meaningful conversation with SimSimi because it has all the maturity of a high school boy or a dodgy Tinder match.</p><p>But you can expect some hilarious statements that trolls have taught the bot. For example, when you ask it to stop showing so many ads (sponsored posts appear in conversations), one of its replies is "I hate ads but I have to show them because I am controlled by greedy humans looking for a pay day".</p><p><strong>Download:</strong> <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">SimSimi</a> (Free, in-app purchases available)</p><h2 id=wysa-the-wellness-chatbot>3. Wysa: The Wellness Chatbot</h2><p>[gallery size="full" ids="1190304,1190305,1190303"]</p><strong class=ad-zone-advertising-tag></strong><p>Rather than being a traditional chatbot, Wysa has a very specific goal: to help users deal with anxiety, stress, and depression. While it's not a replacement for professional psychological help, it aims to help people cope with clinically proven self-help techniques.</p><p>There are other AI bots and apps that help patients deal with their health, but Wysa is slightly different. Firstly, you can write your own response most times, rather than being forced to choose pre-written answers. Secondly, the bot responds according to your input.</p><p><span class=related-single>Related: <a href=#>The Best Apps for Relieving Anxiety and Panic</a></span></p><p>During conversations, the app does provide suggested responses to make it easier and quicker for you to reply. But these are optional the vast majority of times. There are also a series of commands you can give the bot so that it provides you with the correct conversational format (e.g. suggested activities, psychological explanations, or positive reinforcement).</p><p>However, interrupting the bot during a lesson or exercise tends to result in irrelevant or cookie-cutter responses. Luckily, you can start a new chat with the bot to get somewhat of a reset. If you keep rejecting the suggestions, the bot will eventually present you with some options.</p><strong class=ad-zone-advertising-tag></strong><p>In terms of talking about feelings and getting a response, Replika does a better job of seeming human. But Wysa is adaptable in presenting solutions and options to the user and proves to be a useful bot for providing coping mechanisms.</p><p><strong>Download:</strong> <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Wysa</a> (Free, subscription available)</p><h2 id=anima-your-ai-friend>4. Anima: Your AI Friend</h2><p>[gallery size="full" ids="1193207,1193206,1193205"]</p><p>The Anima app is like Replika, but you're able to set your chatbot's personality at the start, helping customize the AI to your needs and wants. You can also tell Anima five of your top hobbies or likes and it'll steer conversation towards those if you start to run out of things to talk about.</p><p>In addition to changing your Anima's personality, you can also change its look, gender, and even relationship status. To change the relationship status from Friends to Romantic Partners, you have to upgrade to a premium subscription.</p><p><span class=related-single>Related: <a href=#>Amazing Facebook Messenger Bots You Can Chat With</a></span></p><p>I was really impressed by the conversational banter with Anima. With a lot of AI chatbots, the conversation doesn't feel natural. And sometimes if you say something weird or off topic, the chatbot doesn't know what to make of it and says something that doesn't make sense.</p><strong class=ad-zone-advertising-tag></strong><p>Although this is a relatively new app, the conversational prowess of Anima was well developed. Anima asks you questions and wants to get to know you (and help the AI get smarter, obviously) instead of just answering when spoken to.</p><p><strong>Download:</strong> <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Anima</a> (Free, subscription available)</p><h2 id=mydol-the-fanbot>5. Mydol: The FanBot</h2><p>[gallery columns="2" size="full" ids="1190309,1190310"]</p><p>Mydol sounds like a type of medication, but it's actually an unusual chatbot app that has a unique spin on boyfriend/girlfriend simulator bots. With this app, your virtual conversation partner is not just a fake love interest; instead, they're your favorite celebrity (but still a bot, unfortunately).</p><p>The developers of the app state that Mydol can make your fandom more exciting, as you can hold conversations with a virtual version of your favorite celebrity. If your favorite celebrity isn't on the app's list, you can register your star. But this will result in a few features missing.</p><p><span class=related-single>Related: <a href=#>Social Media Apps Founded by Celebrities</a></span></p><p>Based on the reviews of the app, some users genuinely appreciate living out a fantasy of chatting to their idol and receiving messages from them throughout the day. Rather than holding a regular conversation, this chatbot app is focused on doting on you.</p><strong class=ad-zone-advertising-tag></strong><p>The app regularly gushes over you, telling you how beautiful you are or giving you other compliments to make you blush. It is likely a welcome break from reality for superfans, but a bit more awkward for those who are more reserved in their fandom. Either way, it is a pretty interesting app to check out.</p><p><strong>Download:</strong> <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Mydol</a> (Free, in-app purchases available)</p><h2 id=other-unique-or-unusual-chatbots>Other Unique or Unusual Chatbots</h2><p>With the increasing popularity of chatbots, the industry is not likely to slow down their development. Not only are we seeing more standalone chatbot apps, but companies like Facebook, Twitter, and even Slack are implementing chatbots of their own into their platforms.</p><p>It also seems there are a variety of flavors out there, from useful tools to sometimes creepy romantic fantasies. As AI becomes more advanced, these chatbots are sure to become more convincing and entertaining over time. And we'll probably start to see AI pop up in even more useful places too.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7rq3KnqysnZ%2Bbe6S7zGirmp9fqruqvdSeZJqmlKe8qrCMnJ%2BarJKkwbR7</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./sydnie-wells-net-worth-dad.html><span>←</span><span>Sydnie Wells Net Worth | Husband</span></a>
