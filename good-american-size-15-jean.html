"My design team and I believe that the reason for this is that between size 14 and 16 we switch from using a 'straight' pattern to a 'plus' pattern. In the plus pattern, allowances are made for a totally different body type, which you might not necessarily need if you’re at the higher end of the straight sizes or the lower end of plus," Emma Grede, co-founder of Good American, told BAZAAR.com over email.</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=2 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">So to combat the issue, they invented a new size jean: 15. Launching today, the size 15 jeans will be available as part of Good American's new 'Good Curve' collection in a variety of styles including straight and flare cuts. The price points range from $159 - $169.</p><img alt="Jeans, Clothing, Shoulder, Waist, Denim, Leg, Beauty, Skin, Leggings, Joint, " title="Jeans, Clothing, Shoulder, Waist, Denim, Leg, Beauty, Skin, Leggings, Joint, " width=1486 height=1486 decoding=async data-nimg=1 sizes=100vw src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/hips.hearstapps.com/hmg-prod/images/hbz-good-american-jeans-2-1537380509.jpg style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center><a rel=noopener href=# class="pinterest css-1i6sckr e1c1bym14"><img data-dynamic-svg=true src="https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.harpersbazaar.com/_assets/design-tokens/fre/static/icons/social/pinterest.e8cf655.svg?primary=%2523ffffff" data-testid=dynamic-svg-base height=auto width=auto alt=pinterest style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center></a><p><span class="css-1urwh1q e1geg53v2">Good American</span></p><img alt="White, Photograph, Beauty, Stomach, Jeans, Abdomen, Arm, Waist, Model, Photo shoot, " title="White, Photograph, Beauty, Stomach, Jeans, Abdomen, Arm, Waist, Model, Photo shoot, " width=1314 height=1688 decoding=async data-nimg=1 sizes=100vw src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/hips.hearstapps.com/hmg-prod/images/polaroid-151-1537462214.jpg style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center><a rel=noopener href=# class="pinterest css-1i6sckr e1c1bym14"><img data-dynamic-svg=true src="https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.harpersbazaar.com/_assets/design-tokens/fre/static/icons/social/pinterest.e8cf655.svg?primary=%2523ffffff" data-testid=dynamic-svg-base height=auto width=auto alt=pinterest style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center></a><span class="css-1urwh1q e1geg53v2">Good American</span><p>Behind-the-scenes of Candice Huffine in Good American’s Good Curve jeans.</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=7 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">During a time when many brands are trying to profit off the body positive movement without putting in the work (or even offering plus sizes), Good American's hands-on approach to customer feedback shows it's serious about putting its money where its mouth is.<br></p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=8 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">"A large part of our success comes from listening to our customers and directly applying their feedback. Our new fit and size have been in the works for nearly a year after reviewing our customer data and size patterns. From there, we used social media to find a focus group of women who fell between sizes 14 and 16 and brought them into our office. We measured their bodies, listened to their concerns and needs, and understood what they were looking for when it comes to denim in order to perfect the new size," Grede said.</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=9 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">The fashion industry still has a lot of work to do when it comes to size inclusivity and it could stand to learn a thing or two from Good American's strategy.</p><h5 class="css-1qq1axs e1ghppmw6"><span aria-hidden=true class="css-0 eagam8p0"></span>Shop Good American Jeans Now<span aria-hidden=true class="css-0 eagam8p1"></span></h5><span class="css-1s9owpq ev8dhu51"><img src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/hips.hearstapps.com/rover/profile_photos/765453da-3fc9-4650-8bff-01664371711e_1704808979.png alt="Headshot of Lauren Alexis Fisher" title="Headshot of Lauren Alexis Fisher" width=100% height=100% decoding=async style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center></span><p>Lauren Alexis Fisher is the Senior Editor at Cosmopolitan, overseeing digital content across fashion, lifestyle, beauty, sex, and culture.
