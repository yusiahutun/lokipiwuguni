The song — the first release from the upcoming Okie album — is as honest as his most well-known hits.</p><p>Arranged as slightly more than a guitar and vocal ballad, "A Letter&nbsp;to My Mama" begins in near spoken-word fashion, with Gill expressing his need to put his thoughts down on paper. "I'm sorry is a real good place to start," he sings midway through the first of&nbsp;several unique verses. Steel guitar and a brushed snare drum accompany the singer.</p><p>"I'm sorry I was selfish / Just chalk it up to youth / I got too old to need you / That's just running from the truth," Gill offers before a few lyrics that speak to his parents' relationship and the lesson their troubles taught him. "Looking back I wonder how you ever pulled us through / I can't imagine walking in your shoes."&nbsp;</p><p>"If I could stop this pen from shaking I'd write these words down too / There's no one in this world I love&nbsp;like you," Gill sings before implying the lyrics are just a smidgen of what he wrote down on paper before a song was formed.</p><p>The Okie album will drop on Aug. 23 and include 12 songs Gill wrote or co-wrote. What was intended to be a songwriter's record became something of a concept album, he says. "A friend sent me an email saying, ‘You could have only written this record after living a 60-year-plus life.’ He said, ‘There’s no struggle in these songs, just truth and your experience," Gill shares.</p><p>Look for Gill to return to the road with the <a href=#>Eagles</a> this month. Their European tour will take them through Belgium, Germany and Amsterdam.</p><p><strong>Watch: Vince Gill Talks About His Future With the Eagles</strong></p><p><strong>These Country Superstars Can NOT Be 50 Already!</strong></p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmiskajBprvFnKaupqSnxm%2BvzqZmr6GemLJus8ilo2aZXaGytcDEq2SmsV2irq6tjg%3D%3D</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./stamford-afc-11-football-club-facts.html><span>←</span><span>Stamford AFC: 11 Football Club Facts</span></a>
