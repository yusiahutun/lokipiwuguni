The video shows the charred remains, and the blowtorch. "Whatever she didn't burn she stole from him," Holly said.</p><p>Holly said she then went to the garage and smashed his car windshield, before heading to the basement and flooding it. When they returned to the house, the basement was under 3 inches of water:</p><p>Waiting for your permission to load TikTok Post.</p><p>Apparently all the ex left behind was her orange jail shoes.</p><p>In a <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">GoFundMe</a>, Holy described her brother — whose birthday is just days away — as one of the "most selfless and hardworking people in this world."</p><p>"My brother loved his home more than anything. He is only 23 years old and everything he worked so hard for she destroyed," she said.</p><p>The TikTok comments were flooded with people marveling at Corey's restraint, as well as offers to help him rebuild his home.</p><p>What the TikToks fail to mention is that Corey was also arrested at the scene; per the police report, Corey came running out of the residence as his ex was being arrested, screaming that the police were "worthless f--ks and we did nothing to stop this."</p><p>"He then began screaming 'f--k you, f--k you, you guys are pieces of s--t.'" the officer wrote. "I advised him to stop screaming as it was 0520 in the morning."</p><p>When he didn't, he was arrested for Disorderly Conduct, the report stated.</p><p>Watseka police confirmed to TooFab that the couple were both arrested at 5:20 AM Monday morning, after responding to a "domestic dispute", and taken to county jail.</p><p>Corey was charged with disorderly conduct, while 19-year-old Destiny Davis was charged with Criminal Damage over $500.</p><p>Both bonded out on $5,000.</p><a class="article-block__link js-track-link" href=# data-node-ref=toofab:article:e40e5c4f-399c-47c7-afb1-4d00c47337ec data-container-ref=toofab:article:628e3865-4264-4a68-ae48-82cdecbafa31 data-context='{"section":"article-block","name":"article"}' readability=27><img src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/images.toofab.com/image/3c/5by4/2021/12/22/3ca378ee62bf40ac970628b1fad9e861_xs.jpg width=300 height=240 style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center> <span class="media-credit article-block__media-credit">TikTok</span><p><h4 class="article-block__card-title article-block__card-title--has-credit">Viral TikTok Moments of 2021: From Lizzo and Chris Evans to North's Livestream</h4><span class=article-block__cta-text>View Story</span></p></a><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmisn6Szoq6NnKamZ2Jlf3N7j2tmaWtfoq6vecWio6arXZrFbrPIq6Ofqpmau6V50qaYrKBdqr1utM6uqp5lp57BqXnHmqSmnaJk</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./shinsuke-nakamuras-wife-harumi-maekawa-bio-net-worth-career.html><span>←</span><span>Harumi Maekawa</span></a>
