Trust me, it’s not as difficult as it sounds.</p><p>When you first receive your item, it will have a light coating of a protective, food safe oil.&nbsp; Each time you use the board, you should hand wash with dish soap and hot water, scrubbing to ensure any bits of food are washed off completely, then dry with a paper towel or clean dish towel.</p><p>NEVER USE A DISHWASHER.&nbsp; Never.&nbsp; It will ruin your boards and spoons. Period. Just don’t do it.</p><p><img src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/cdn.shopify.com/s/files/1/1800/9573/files/woodshop_01_1024x1024.jpg alt style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto>&nbsp;</p><p>From time to time, you should refresh the protective coating on your boards.&nbsp; If your board starts to look a little white or dried out, it’s time to oil.&nbsp; While a wood butter containing beeswax provides optimal protection, regular old mineral oil works too.&nbsp; Simply use a clean paper towel to wipe on a generous coating, let it sit overnight, and buff off the excess with a dry towel.&nbsp; This oil keeps your wood moisturized, preventing cracking or splitting, while keeping odors and liquids from your foods from penetrating the wood.</p><p><strong>Some common questions we get and their answers are listed below:</strong></p><p>1. Can I use olive/vegetable/avocado oil instead of mineral oil?</p><p>NOPE. These oils do expire and eventually go rancid, so if you use them on your board it will eventually rot or stink.&nbsp; Food grade wood butter and mineral oil are the only products we recommend.</p><p><strong>&nbsp;</strong></p><p>2. I cut something on my board that left a stain. How can I fix this?</p><p>Certain foods (like beets) will stain.&nbsp; You can sand lightly with a fine grit sandpaper and to soak with lemon juice to lighten the stain, but we recommend saving those foods prone to staining for a plastic board.</p><p>3. Is it okay to cut raw chicken on my board?</p><p>Yes, as long as your board is properly maintained with a protective oil, cutting raw chicken should be okay.&nbsp; Be sure to immediately wash with hot, soapy water and let dry completely before the next use to avoid cross contamination.</p><p>4. How can I get scratches or knife marks out of my board?</p><p>If you cut too deep and your board is left with a mark, you can use a fine grit sandpaper to buff out the scratches.&nbsp; Sand in the direction of the grain, wipe off the dust, and apply a protective oil before using the board again.</p><p>5. I cut an onion on my board, and now everything on it tastes like onions.&nbsp; What do I do?</p><p>Keeping your board properly sealed and washing immediately after use will prevent this problem.&nbsp; However, you can use a lemon cut in half dipped in salt to scrub the board to eliminate any odors.&nbsp; Wash and dry properly, then apply a coating of protective oil to prevent this from happening again.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7ra3Uq5ylpZWnsKK606KjnmaTpLpwrsuonqxnmqTCs7rApWacmaKeu6h5xaipZrGfqr9urtStmqGdomKvrbvCpKpmmZ6Zeri7zp2cp2WbnsGktMSnZKKslaLA</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./395829-100-south-african-baby-names-meanings-html.html><span>←</span><span>100+ South African baby names and their meanings</span></a>
