Both wearing the Los Angeles-based designer Harbison, Bush opted for a black strapless dress with pockets and gold, geometric-shaped buttons down the front, while Harris went for wide-leg black pants and a matching metallic jacket with studded detailing.&nbsp;<br></p><figure id=mntl-sc-block_5-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block instyle-sc-block-image mntl-sc-block-universal-image mntl-sc-block-image--no-theme no-theme mntl-sc-block-image figure-portrait figure-high-res"><span class=figure-article-caption-owner><p>Getty</p></span></figure><p id=mntl-sc-block_6-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">They each accessorized with Briony Raymond jewelry, however, they wore different designers on their feet. Bush chose a pair of Aquazzura heels, which were partially hidden underneath her floor-length dress, and Harris opted for black Saint Laurent square-toe shoes.&nbsp;<br></p><p id=mntl-sc-block_8-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">Bush and Harris's red carpet debut came just days after the One Tree Hill alum came out as "queer" in an essay written for <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=externalLink data-ordinal=1>Glamour</a>. “I finally feel like I can breathe. I don’t think I can explain how profound that is,” Bush wrote of her coming out journey. "I feel like I was wearing a weighted vest for who knows how long. I hadn’t realized how heavy it was until I finally just put it down."<br></p><figure id=mntl-sc-block_10-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block instyle-sc-block-image mntl-sc-block-universal-image mntl-sc-block-image--no-theme no-theme mntl-sc-block-image figure-portrait figure-high-res"><span class=figure-article-caption-owner><p>Getty</p></span></figure><p id=mntl-sc-block_11-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">She continued, "This might sound crazy — but I think other people in trauma recovery will get it — I am taking deep breaths again. I can feel my legs and feet. I can feel my feet in my shoes right now. It makes me want to cry and laugh at the same time."<br></p><p id=mntl-sc-block_15-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">The actress also addressed rumors that she was a "home-wrecker," writing: “The idea that I left my marriage based on some hysterical rendezvous — that, to be crystal-clear, never happened — rather than having taken over a year to do the most soul crushing work of my life? It feels brutal."&nbsp;<br></p><p id=mntl-sc-block_17-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">The pair first met in 2019 but it wasn't until their respective splits — Bush <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=internalLink data-ordinal=1>filed for divorce</a> from Grant Hughes in August 2023 after one year of marriage, while Harris split from her ex-wife Ali Krieger a month later — that they got closer. “Maybe it was all fated. Maybe it really is a version of invisible string theory. I don’t really know,” Bush wrote of their relationship. “But I do know that for a sparkly moment I felt like maybe the universe had been conspiring for me. And that feeling that I have in my bones is one I’ll hold on to no matter where things go from here.”&nbsp;</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7qrrSrbClnV6YvK570qinoaGRYq%2B2v8dmmKygnK67brTAq6miq12nsqV5wpqpqZ2kYrGmrtStZLCgk5l6eYKTaWhrbg%3D%3D</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./phil-dunster-dating-wife.html><span>←</span><span>Phil Dunster Doesn't Have Wife But Has Been Dating For 5 Years</span></a>
