Furthermore, they have been passionate whenever they have delivered their music. Whether that delivery is melancholic or aggressive, it hits the listener with that passion and feeling with no fear of judgement. However, all that cannot happen if a band is not creative in creating fascinating rhythms for the vocals demanded in the subgenre.</p><a class=c-article-read-also__image-wrapper href=#><img sizes=256px style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/netstorage-tuko.akamaized.net/images/75b6f0e087fffec0.jpg></a><a class=c-article-read-also__headline href=# readability=27><p class=c-article-read-also__caption>Read also</p><p class=c-article-read-also__headline-wrapper><span class=c-article-read-also__headline-hover-inner>The 15 best white rappers of all time: Who ranks number 1?</span></p></a><h2>15 best black metal bands</h2><p class=align-left>Black metal has proven hard to eliminate. While sensational violence and a flirtation with the occult have often threatened to eclipse the genre's artistic merits, it is ultimately the music that has given this dark practice its longevity. Here are some of the best <a href=# rel="nofollow noopener">black metal bands</a> that have made the genre a must-listen for rock fans.</p><h3>1. Bathory</h3><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/netstorage-tuko.akamaized.net/images/75b6f0e087fffec0.jpg><p class=align-left>Bathory is a black metal band often considered the greatest in Sweden. The band pioneered black metal and Viking metal in Sweden and became the blueprint of the subgenre in the entire Scandinavian. Although the group dissolved in the early 2000s, they remain some of the best <a href=#>writers</a> of the industry's most evil records ever produced.</p><p class=align-left>Furthermore, their songwriting skills have passed the test of time. For example, in 1987, they wrote the song <i>Under the Sign of the Black Mark.</i> The song was a masterpiece and has since become one of the most copied sounds ever within the realm of black metal. In addition, Bathory released many albums that operated in a dark and hellish atmosphere, a factor that solidified them as one of the greatest black metal bands of all time.</p><a class=c-article-read-also__image-wrapper href=#><img sizes=256px style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/netstorage-tuko.akamaized.net/images/d603b0c2d2484cc0.jpg></a><a class=c-article-read-also__headline href=# readability=27><p class=c-article-read-also__caption>Read also</p><p class=c-article-read-also__headline-wrapper><span class=c-article-read-also__headline-hover-inner>15 richest metal bands in the world and their net worth in 2021</span></p></a><h3>2. Burzum</h3><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/netstorage-tuko.akamaized.net/images/2e37f202d3e66c1b.jpg><p class=align-left>Burzum was a Norwegian black metal music project established in 1991 by Varg Vikernes. The group was one of the best Norwegian black metal bands because they played a significant role in the rise of black metal during the second wave. Varg Vikernes mainly was alone when he recorded all the Burzum albums.</p><p class=align-left>Although the band never went live throughout its lifespan, its songs became fan-favourites because the lyrics were dark and filled with fantasy and mythology. Furthermore, Burzum ensured his songs had an excellent combination of ambience and metal, two factors that made them masterpieces. Even today, fans of the genre consider Burzum the black metal Mozart because of the high skill level in composing its pieces.</p><h3>3. Celtic Frost</h3><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/netstorage-tuko.akamaized.net/images/d603b0c2d2484cc0.jpg><p class=align-left>Celtic Frost was a black metal band from Zurich formed in 1984. Although Celtic Frost was a black metal band, they were also best known for their creativeness in developing extreme metal and avant-garde metal. The group released its debut album in 1984 titled <i>Morbid Tales</i>. <i>Morbid Tales</i> had a thrash metal intensity that influenced death metal.</p><a class=c-article-read-also__image-wrapper href=#><img sizes=256px style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/netstorage-tuko.akamaized.net/images/b71e4975e344d6c3.jpg></a><a class=c-article-read-also__headline href=# readability=27><p class=c-article-read-also__caption>Read also</p><p class=c-article-read-also__headline-wrapper><span class=c-article-read-also__headline-hover-inner>10 greatest black female rock singers of all time</span></p></a><p class=align-left>The debut <a href=#>song </a>is one of the reasons people still consider Celtic Frost one of the best death metal bands of all time. Celtic Frost had a specific form of music that combined elements of different extreme metal styles. Most of their albums are akin to gothic and doom metal. But despite their dissolution, the group remains the most influential metal band to come out of Switzerland.</p><h3>4. Darkthrone</h3><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/netstorage-tuko.akamaized.net/images/59dd909cf5f6366b.jpg><p class=align-left>Darkthrone first came to existence in 1986 as a death metal band. However, by the end of 1990, the group changed their singing and composing songs and embraced a black metal style. The reason for choosing black metal is because they got their inspiration from other leading bands, such as Bathory and Celtic Frost.</p><p class=align-left>Unlike many black metal bands of the 1990s, Darkthrone is the only Norwegian<a href=#> band </a>that continues to produce songs even in 2021. Although they may not be the wealthiest black metal band, the group has continued to evolve their artistic vision and sounds in all the albums it has released. And for 35 years since the band formed, it has remained the most subtle, iconic, and musically refined pioneer of the second wave of black metal.</p><a class=c-article-read-also__image-wrapper href=#><img sizes=256px style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/netstorage-tuko.akamaized.net/images/7fb13e44fa95ebcc.jpg></a><a class=c-article-read-also__headline href=# readability=27><p class=c-article-read-also__caption>Read also</p><p class=c-article-read-also__headline-wrapper><span class=c-article-read-also__headline-hover-inner>Rekless from Ethic: quick facts and top songs</span></p></a><h3>5.

The band was first inspired by the incarnations of the black metal genre from the 80s and early 90s. They made their debut into the underground metal scene by rehearsing unofficial cassette tapes.</p><p class=align-left>Soon afterwards, Dimmu Borgir mastered the art of composing black metal songs. The group began producing resplendent music in melodic vocals, sombre guitar works, haunting keyboard melodies, and destructive drums.</p><p class=align-left>In 1995, they released their first album titled <i>For all Lid</i> that offered a somewhat splendid view of heavy metal that came off as more ambitious. As of 2021, the band has released ten studio albums, two compilation albums, three video albums, 15 music videos, four extended plays, and six singles.</p><h3>6. Emperor</h3><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/netstorage-tuko.akamaized.net/images/b71e4975e344d6c3.jpg><p class=align-left>Emperor is a top black metal band from Norway formed in 1991.

After 30 years, Emperor produced four studio albums, six extended plays, and three compilation albums.</p><h3>7. Enslaved</h3><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/netstorage-tuko.akamaized.net/images/08daae23e0d59d03.jpg><p class=align-left>Enslaved is an extreme metal and black metal band from Haugesund, Norway, formed in June 1991.

Gorgoroth produced six studio albums, three live albums, and one video album.

Hate Forest</h3><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/netstorage-tuko.akamaized.net/images/8a3a9b83bd129969.jpg><p class=align-left>While many black metal bands find their origin in Scandinavian nations, Hate Forest is an exception. It is a black metal band from Ukraine formed by Roman Saenko in 1995. Even though it is a Ukrainian band, it drew its inspiration from Scandinavian black metal bands.

Although they had several singles and compilation albums, they released the songs years later. But nobody can deny Hellhammer’s role in the rise of extreme metal.

The late release of the songs and excellent reception from fans adequately documents that legacy.</p><a class=c-article-read-also__image-wrapper href=#><img sizes=256px style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/netstorage-tuko.akamaized.net/images/83231cf826291b0a.jpg></a><a class=c-article-read-also__headline href=# readability=27><p class=c-article-read-also__caption>Read also</p><p class=c-article-read-also__headline-wrapper><span class=c-article-read-also__headline-hover-inner>10 best UB40 songs ranked</span></p></a><h3>11.
