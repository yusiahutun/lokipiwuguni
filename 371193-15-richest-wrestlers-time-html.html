It speaks of hard work, innovation, and diversification. Most of the richest wrestlers in the world did not earn their fortune from wrestling. They are entrepreneurs, actors, show hosts, and even musicians. Anything that makes money is not off the table until they try it and succeed or fail. This could serve as a life lesson for the young generation who idolize the wrestling superstars.</p><p class=align-left>Tuko.co.ke reported on July 9th that Rey Mysterio revealed his rarely seen face during his wife's birthday.
