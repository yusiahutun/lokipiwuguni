No completó un buen partido el Real Madrid en Munich, aunque tampoco le hizo falta para sacar un buen resultado de cara a la vuelta. Lo que ocurrió en el Allianz Arena resume a la perfección su devenir esta temporada: juegue bien, mal o regular, domine o sea dominado, el equipo saca adelante sus partidos de forma invariable.Después de 48 encuentros este curso sólo el Atlético ha sido capaz de derrotarle, algo que logró en dos ocasiones: una en Liga en septiembre (3-1), y la otra en enero en octavos de la Copa (4-2 en la prórroga), una semana después de que los de Ancelotti les eliminaran en semifinales de la Supercopa de Arabia.</article><article class=post-entry><h2>17 Best Kentucky Derby Hats</h2><time>Feb 1, 2024</time>

Kate Middleton might be known as a fashion inspiration, but not everyone is a fan of her latest look. On Sunday, The Duchess of Cambridge came under fire for wearing green instead of black in support of Time’s Up at the 2018 BAFTA Awards. The 36-year-old—who, per royal protocol, is forced to remain politically neutral—was slammed and accused of being “anti-feminist” for her outfit choice.
Though Middleton faced major backlash, she found the support of one of Time’s Up’s most prominent leaders, Olivia Munn, who perfectly explained why the anti-sexism and anti-harassment movement means more than a dress color.</article><article class=post-entry><h2>Patrick Cantlay: wife, net worth, caddie, career earnings, stats, parents</h2><time>Feb 1, 2024</time>
