Now that fans have responded to her controversial thoughts, she’s posted a cryptic message on social media following the backlash.</strong></p><p>Snow White is set to be transformed into a modern-day fairy tale, with Rachel Zegler taking on the iconic <a href=#>movie</a> role. Following on from major remakes in the classic Disney animation archive such as Cinderella, Mulan and The Little Mermaid, Snow White is the next one heading back into the <a href=#>Hollywood</a> studio. But, the actress has received backlash online for her comments about the film and storyline.</p><figure class="wp-block-grvmedia-grv-video GRVMultiVideo"></figure><h2 class=wp-block-heading id=h-rachel-zegler-was-scared-of-snow-white-growing-up>Rachel Zegler was ‘scared’ of Snow White growing up</h2><p>Despite being cast as the lead in Snow White, it turns out Rachel Zegler wasn’t a fan growing up.</p><p>An interview with Entertainment Weekly last December has been <a href=# rel=nofollow>unearthed</a> and is going viral online. In the clip, she explains she only watched the Disney classic once.</p><p>“I was scared of the original version,” she said. “I think I watched it once and never picked it up again. I’m being so serious.”</p><figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-video is-provider-youtube wp-block-embed-youtube wp-embed-aspect-16-9 wp-has-aspect-ratio"><p></p></figure><p>She added: “I watched it once, and then I went on the ride in Disney World, which was called ‘Snow White’s Scary Adventures.’ Doesn’t sound like something a little kid would like. I was terrified of it, never revisited Snow White again.”</p><p>Rachel didn’t stop there, she then suggested the Prince was a ‘stalker’ and said a modern-day Snow White wouldn’t be interested in finding love.</p><p>She told Extra TV: “The original cartoon came out in 1937, and very evidently so. There’s a big focus on her love story with a guy who literally stalks her. Weird! Weird! So we didn’t do that this time.”</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading>‘It’s not anti-feminist to want to fall in love’</h2><p>However, Zegler’s comments on a modern-day Snow White not wanting to fall in love have had a positive reaction. <a href=#>Influencers</a> have been posting responses to her thoughts. One <a href=#>TikTok</a> user called her out and said wanting to be a “homemaker” is just as valuable as any other desire.</p><p>Another TikToker, @nuttybutter96, echoed the same thoughts.</p><p>They said: “I don’t think I’ve ever seen such a condescending, smug, Disney princess ever in my life.</p><p>“She made us sound like women only matter if they’re hateful of love, hateful of any kind of romance, and we only exist to thrive and be a leader.”</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading>Rachel Zegler’s cryptic post</h2><p>After the weekend of backlash, the star posted on <a href=#>Twitter</a> with six words – a cryptic message after the negativity.</p><p>She simply wrote: “I hope the world becomes kinder.”</p><p>In a follow-up tweet, she added: “I love you very much. Forever and ever. Remember to be kind. Treat each other with patience and empathy. Remember that you are loved unconditionally, no matter your mistakes, no matter your misunderstandings. You deserve it, you deserve love. You deserve to live without fear. x”</p><p>The star then re-tweeted a Taylor Swift lyric bot that had posted: “It must be exhausting always rooting for the anti-hero.”</p><p>The <a href=#>celebrity</a> is set to appear in the Hunger Games prequel, titled The Ballad of Songbirds and Snakes. Alongside Hunter Schafer, Peter Dinklage and Jason Schwartzman, it’s a spin-off from the hit trilogy from author Suzanne Collins.</p><p>Set in the dystopian Panem, we follow president Coriolanus Snow (Tom Blyth) decades before he caused misery as the leader. The teenage Snow, a mentor in the Hunger Games, attempts to train a tribute, Lucy Gray Baird, and keep her alive in the horror competition.</p><p>Related Topics</p><p>MORE CELEBRITY STORIES</p><span></span><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7pLHLnpmroaSuwaqwwaKrZ5ufonxzfJFsZmlwX2aBcL7AnJ%2BepF2vsqi4xKuqZpuirr21tcJmqqKwXay8s7CMq5ysqJ%2BjwKZ5wJ%2BrnqpdqLuww4ywn6KslWK6sMLInmSbmZOguaK%2Fx2g%3D</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./puppy-love-cheryl-cole-singer-18642123.html><span>←</span><span>Puppy love for Cheryl Cole!
