For Marsh, who came from a family of soccer players, it must have been a question of inheritance. His father played as a wide receiver in the Canadian Football League and also in the NFL.</p><p>He joined the NFL in 1995 when he was drafted in the seventh round of the Jacksonville Jaguars. Other teams where he has demonstrated his soccer skills include the Pittsburgh Steelers and the Saskatchewan Roughriders.</p><p>Cassius has a half-brother, Curtis Marsh Jr. by his father.
