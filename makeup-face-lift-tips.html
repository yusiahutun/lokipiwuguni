And while <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=internalLink data-ordinal=1>facial sculpting tools</a> and <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=internalLink data-ordinal=2>collagen creams</a> may yield results with prolonged use, there's a quicker, albeit temporary, solution that's taking hold of beauty enthusiasts and influencers everywhere: makeup. Lately, we've been seeing tons of videos on how to apply makeup to give your face a more lifted appearance and were curious to learn more. So we tapped two celebrity makeup artists to get their best tips on how to get a <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=internalLink data-ordinal=3>faux-face lift</a> using none other than the right makeup products and techniques.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_5-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">Keep scrolling for eight expert-approved tips for giving yourself a "face lift" using makeup.</p><span class=heading-toc id=toc-pay-attention-to-where-you-place-your-blush></span><h2 id=mntl-sc-block_7-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block instyle-sc-block-heading mntl-sc-block-heading"><span class=mntl-sc-block-heading__text>Pay Attention to Where You Place Your Blush</span></h2><p id=mntl-sc-block_8-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">Makeup artist <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=externalLink data-ordinal=1>Christen Dominique</a> demonstrates how the right blush placement can instantly "lift" your face. The technique is referred to as blush draping, explains <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=externalLink data-ordinal=2>Sir John</a>, a celebrity makeup artist with a client roster filled with A-list celebrities like Zendaya and Beyoncé. The idea is, instead of adding blush to the apples of your cheeks, you apply it on the high points of your face to create lift.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_10-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">"Make sure that you go high on the temples of the cheek with blush," says Sir John. A little bit of product on the tops of the cheeks, and even on the temples will help create that sculpted look without contour.</p><span class=heading-toc id=toc-blend-your-contour-upward></span><h2 id=mntl-sc-block_16-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block instyle-sc-block-heading mntl-sc-block-heading"><span class=mntl-sc-block-heading__text>Blend Your Contour Upward</span></h2><p id=mntl-sc-block_17-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">If you choose to contour your face, <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=externalLink data-ordinal=1>Jamie Dorman</a>, a celebrity makeup artist, says to make sure to blend upward after placing color, which will create a lifted appearance. We recommend a cream contour, like <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=externalLink data-ordinal=2 rel=nofollow>Makeup by Mario Soft Sculpting Stick</a> ($30), which will be easier to work with and blend as needed.</p><span class=heading-toc id=toc-skip-heavy-concealer-application></span><h2 id=mntl-sc-block_21-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block instyle-sc-block-heading mntl-sc-block-heading"><span class=mntl-sc-block-heading__text>Skip Heavy Concealer Application</span></h2><p id=mntl-sc-block_22-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">Gone are the days of applying concealer in a large triangle under the eye if your goals are to lift. Instead, apply concealer on the inner and outer corner of the eye going upwards to highlight and — you guessed it — to lift. Not only does it give beautiful results, but it also requires less product and can be used for <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=internalLink data-ordinal=1>natural no-makeup makeup</a> or ultra-glam looks.</p><span class=heading-toc id=toc-dont-contour-your-forehead-too-much></span><h2 id=mntl-sc-block_26-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block instyle-sc-block-heading mntl-sc-block-heading"><span class=mntl-sc-block-heading__text>Don't Contour Your Forehead Too Much</span></h2><p id=mntl-sc-block_27-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">Another contouring trick that will offer a youthful radiance is to go easy on the contour. "Try not to contour your forehead too much," says Sir John. "That closes the face and minimizes what the eye can see."</p><span class=heading-toc id=toc-try-a-lifting-eyeliner-technique></span><h2 id=mntl-sc-block_29-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block instyle-sc-block-heading mntl-sc-block-heading"><span class=mntl-sc-block-heading__text>Try a Lifting Eyeliner Technique</span></h2><p id=mntl-sc-block_30-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">Not only can you lift the appearance of your face, but you can also do so with the eyes. One trick Sir John recommends? The lifting eyeliner technique. "Start in the tear ducts and give yourself a beautiful saturated line with a pencil or gel along the upper lash line," he says. "Once you get to the pupil of your eye, instead of going down, go slightly up, so it gives a lifting effect. Lifting liners can elongate the eyes and make them appear brighter, wider, and bigger."</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_32-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">For a visual on this technique and others like it, check out Sir John's "<a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=externalLink data-ordinal=1 rel=noopener>The Art of Makeup</a>" series available on <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=externalLink data-ordinal=2 rel=noopener>Assemble</a>, a digital platform where Black and brown innovators share lessons from their careers. The episode "All About the Eyes" is great for learning more eye makeup application tips.</p><span class=heading-toc id=toc-place-mascara-on-center-lashes></span><h2 id=mntl-sc-block_34-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block instyle-sc-block-heading mntl-sc-block-heading"><span class=mntl-sc-block-heading__text>Place Mascara on Center Lashes</span></h2><p id=mntl-sc-block_35-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">Concentrate most of your mascara on the center of the eyes and less on the outer parts, says Sir John. "That will induce that 'Bambi' effect that we love to see," he adds. One of our favorite mascaras that offers lift and volume is the <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=externalLink data-ordinal=1 rel=nofollow>Ilia Beauty Fullest Volumizing Mascara</a> ($28).</p><span class=heading-toc id=toc-try-a-lateral-brow></span><h2 id=mntl-sc-block_39-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block instyle-sc-block-heading mntl-sc-block-heading"><span class=mntl-sc-block-heading__text>Try a Lateral Brow</span></h2><p id=mntl-sc-block_40-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">When it comes to the brows, opt for a softer, subtle arch (think: Audrey Hepburn brows). Sir John says brows that are more of a lateral shape elongate the face and emphasize the bone structure and eyes. "The goal with the lifted look is to make sure that you see a radiant complexion with open and fresh eyes that are aware and awake," he says.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_42-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">Dorman also recommends highlighting directly underneath the high point of the brow instead of underneath the entire brow bone. "Use a precision brush for this, such as <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=externalLink data-ordinal=1 rel=nofollow>Westmore Beauty Dual Side Brow Brush</a> ($19) with a cream highlighter," she says. <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=externalLink data-ordinal=2 rel=nofollow>Charlotte Tilbury Beauty Highlighter Wand</a> ($42) is a cream highlighter that never disappoints.</p><span class=heading-toc id=toc-dont-focus-on-the-bottom-lash-line></span><h2 id=mntl-sc-block_46-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block instyle-sc-block-heading mntl-sc-block-heading"><span class=mntl-sc-block-heading__text>Don't Focus on the Bottom Lash Line</span></h2><p id=mntl-sc-block_47-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">Finally, Sir John recommends keeping the makeup on the bottom lash line minimal. Again, less is more. To make the eyes pop, he says to try a beige liner on the bottom lash line. Avoid <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=internalLink data-ordinal=1>white eyeliner</a> as it can be too stark of a difference.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7qrrSrbClnV6YvK57wZ6YrqypZLqit8Sup2ilkaCytryMn5icnV2htqfAjK2gqas%3D</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./donna-karan-dkny-labels-sold-calvin-klein-owner-after-sales.html><span>←</span><span>Donna Karan, DKNY labels sold to Calvin Klein owner after sales disappoint</span></a>
