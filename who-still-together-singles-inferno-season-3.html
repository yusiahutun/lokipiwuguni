Couples Now 2024</h1></header><section class=post-content><p><strong>Spoilers ahead for Single’s Inferno season 3 finale.</strong> So many twists and turns during this season that were truly unexpected. After the shocking finale, many fans of this Korean dating show might want to know who in<a href=#>&nbsp;Single’s Inferno&nbsp;season 3 are still together</a>.</p><p>Single’s Inferno&nbsp;debuted in 2021 and skyrocketed to be one of Netflix’s most-watched reality TV shows due to the shocking and dramatic nature. 12 contestants are put on a&nbsp;<a href=#>deserted island</a>&nbsp;called “Inferno” and compete through challenges to couple up. Once a desired couple is matched, they are sent to “Paradise” which is a fancy luxury hotel where they could be able to&nbsp;<a href=#>get to know</a>&nbsp;one another. Along with all the suspense and pairing, a set of panelists comment on the show including comedian Hong Jin-kyung, actress Lee Da-hee, Super Junior member Kyuhyun, rapper Hanhae, and YouTuber and season 2 alum Dex.</p><p>In an interview with&nbsp;<a rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow" href=#>Netflix Tudum</a>, producer Kim Na-hyun shared if there’s room for the cast to be in touch with each other after they leave the island. “I see them interacting on Instagram, so I think it’s safe to say that they’re still in contact. Because they spent eight nights and nine days on an island together, where they not only built relationships but also friendships, they are probably still close.”</p><p>Season 3 started with two separate Infernos happening at the same exact time—leading to different merges, interesting choices, and most importantly a whole lot of drama.</p><p>In the last episode of season 3, four couples left Inferno together. While four people remained in Inferno including Son Won-ik, Cho Min-ji, Yun Ha-bin, and Yun Ha-jeong. So which of the Single’s Inferno couples are still together? We investigated below.</p><ul class="pmc-fallback-list-items lrv-a-unstyle-list lrv-u-margin-t-2"><li class="pmc-fallback-list-item-wrap lrv-u-margin-b-2" readability=-2><h2>Who's still together from Single's Inferno Season 3?</h2><p>Read on for which Singles Inferno Season 3 couples are still together.</p></li><li class="pmc-fallback-list-item-wrap lrv-u-margin-b-2" readability=3.8585209003215><h2>Are Gwan-hee and Hye-seon still together after Single's Inferno season 3?</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/stylecaster.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/01/gwanhee-hye-seon.jpeg><p>Are Gwan-hee and Hye-seon still together after Single’s Inferno season 3? It’s unknown whether or not Gwan-hee and Hye-seon are still together after the show ended. Gwan-hee posted a <a rel=nofollow href=# data-type=link data-id="https://www.instagram.com/p/C140B0NyGjG/?img_index=10">photo of the cast </a>members and some fans on Reddit noticed that Hye-seon <a rel=nofollow href=# data-type=link data-id=https://www.reddit.com/r/Singlesinferno2/comments/192uorw/gh_posted_their_pics_together_and_hs_gave_cute/>posted a comment </a>that translated to, “the pic is too dark, I told you if you want to post lmk first so I can add filter” and deleted it quickly.</p><p>Gwan-hee has been a source of drama in the show with the kinds of games he plays with his love interests, but he decided to settle down with Hye-seon after an emotional conversation during one of the last days on the island. I felt like I would keep thinking about Hye-seon if I picked Min-ji but I didn’t think I would think about Min-ji as much if I picked Hye-Seon. So in the end, I didn’t hesitate in picking Hye-Seon.”</p></li><li class="pmc-fallback-list-item-wrap lrv-u-margin-b-2" readability=2.3717948717949><h2>Are Si-eun and Min-woo still together after Single's Inferno season 3?</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/stylecaster.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/01/si-eun-min-woo.jpg><p>Are Si-eun and Min-woo still together after Single’s Inferno season 3?
