The country superstar has revealed the cover of The Anthology, Part II: The Next Five Years, which is now available for sale.</p><p>The new career retrospective follows the previously released&nbsp;Anthology, Part 1: The First Five Years. The new package chronicles the period from&nbsp;1996-2001 in Brooks' legendary career, told in his own words, as well as through interviews with those who were directly involved.</p><p>The Anthology, Part II: The Next Five Years shares inside stories from a run of albums that included&nbsp;Fresh Horses, Sevens, The Limited Series, Double Live&nbsp;and&nbsp;Scarecrow. Among the stories are&nbsp;Brooks's recollection of recording "Beer Run" with <a href=#>George Jones</a>, as well as his marathon 24-hour autograph signing session at Fan Fair in Nashville in 1996. The book also details why Sevens got delayed and delves into Brooks' decision to announce his retirement.</p><p>“The way I see it, Garth spent the first five years of that crazy ride just hanging on for dear life!" <a href=#>Trisha Yearwood</a> says. "In the second five years, you start to see a captain steering his own ship.”</p><p>"I learned a lot!" Brooks states in reference to the new interviews with <a href=#>Bob Dylan</a>, <a href=#>Keith Urban</a>, <a href=#>Steve Wariner</a> and more, which, he says, "just floored me!"</p><p>The new release includes a 6-disc set of musical highlights from the albums Brooks released during that period of his career, as well as two previously unreleased recordings.</p><p>"Miss Yearwood claimed there was a duet version of ‘To Make You Feel My Love’ that only she remembered," Brooks shares. "But when we found it buried deep in the vault, I was amazed how raw and beautiful it was!"</p><p>The Anthology, Part II: The Next Five Years is <a href=#>currently available for pre-order</a>. The set is slated for release on Nov. 15, 2022.</p><figure class="img-tag has-sizer aligncenter"><p><span class=visually-hidden>garth-brooks-anthology-2</span></p>TalkShopLive<p>loading...</p></figure><p>Brooks has also been on the road for his 2022 Stadium Tour, which wraps its North American leg with a show in Houston on Aug. 6. <a href=#>Buy Garth Brooks tickets here</a>.</p><h2 class=photogallery-title>The Best Country Singer From Every State</h2>Some states, like Oklahoma and Texas, are loaded with famous country singers.
