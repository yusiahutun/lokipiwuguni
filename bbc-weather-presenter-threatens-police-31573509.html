Recalling the start of the harassment, she told the BBC: "I had a few messages from this guy and they were inappropriate, saying something like, 'You are warming up my house tonight'."</p><p>After Alexis blocked him, the man made a new account one month later and would message her up to three times a day. He would send explicit videos and describe his sexual desires to her.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/i2-prod.dailystar.co.uk/incoming/article31555747.ece/ALTERNATES/s458/0_Bobby-Brazier.jpg><p>It began to impact Alexis' work as she told Sally Nugent: "My legs were shaking, my hands were shaking, I was trying to hold it together on air. Obviously you've got a job to do, you have to present something to the public.</p><p>"I felt I had a job to do but I also felt very anxious and scared at the same time." In March of this year, the 55-year-old was jailed for 17 weeks and given a restraining order.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/s2-prod.mirror.co.uk/@trinitymirrordigital/chameleon-branding/publications/dailystar/img/logo-schema-dailystar.png><p>Reflecting on the court case, she added: "Obviously the court case was horrendous for me... I sat there in the dock shaking. It was really, really hard but at the end of it I had a result."</p><p>Alexis added: "It has made me afraid, I am scared to do certain things - I won't go for a run on my own anymore, I take the dog. I feel that there is that protection in place but it is not going to help me, it is not going to help my personal feelings, my anxiety, I'll always have that with me."</p><p><b><i>For the latest breaking news and stories from across the globe from the Daily Star, sign up for our newsletter by clicking</i> </b><a data-content-type=section data-link-tracking=InArticle|Link href=#><b><i>here</i></b></a></p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7pa3IpbCsrJGne6S7ja6iaKymZK%2Bjr4ywnJqsmJq%2FbrzRnqqepqSav27Ax6ucmqyVo8BuvM6loJydXWh%2BdoOSbmdy</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./axelle-francine-bio-net-worth-age-wiki-married-husband-ethnicity.html><span>←</span><span>Axelle Francine Bio, Net Worth, Age, Wiki, Married, Husband and Ethnicity</span></a>
