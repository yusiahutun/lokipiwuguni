Although some Selenators (hardcore fans of his ex-girlfriend) can get carried away on social media, it’s clear they’re in love.</strong></p><p>However, despite being married for five years, the <a href=#>celebrity couple</a> have had their ups and downs in the past. For their nuptials, they decided a different approach, saying ‘I Do’ in a New York City courthouse instead of a lavish affair. They did then plan a more formal wedding the following year to celebrate it with friends and family though, but it’s not what you expect from a <a href=#>celebrity</a>.</p><figure class="wp-block-grvmedia-grv-video GRVMultiVideo"></figure><h2 class=wp-block-heading id=h-hailey-bieber-discusses-marriage-with-justin-on-podcast>Hailey Bieber discusses marriage with Justin on podcast</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/cdn1.celebritytidbit.com/uploads/39/2024/02/GettyImages-1340143161-1024x683.jpg><p>The 27-year-old, along with her pop star hubby, <a href=# rel=nofollow>spoke</a> on the In Good Faith with Chelsea and Judah Smith podcast in November 2021.</p><p>She confessed she “really hurt” her husband before they got married, which sparked a long spell when they didn’t talk at all. Whilst she was 24 at the time, she opened up about their high-profile romance in the public eye.</p><p>She said: “It was actually very sad when we didn’t speak.</p><p>“I did something that really hurt him, and I think that kind of maybe took that idea (of marrying me) out of his mind at that point.”</p><p>“There was really one solidified moment where I think it damaged the idea of me for you,” she told Justin.</p><p>Although Hailey didn’t explain what she said to <a href=#>Justin Bieber</a> that could have taken marriage off the table, she said it was “something very immature and stupid”.</p><p>The model said even though they didn’t speak, and were “not cool with each other”, she didn’t stop dreaming about becoming Mrs Bieber.</p><p>“I just don’t think that that (desire) is B.S., because he doesn’t have to say that. That doesn’t have to be what he wants,” she explained. “But the biggest thing in his heart that he always wanted is that.”</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading id=h-hailey-and-justin-s-love-story>Hailey and Justin’s love story</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/cdn1.celebritytidbit.com/uploads/39/2024/02/GettyImages-1370385955-1024x708.jpg><p><a href=#>Hailey Bieber</a> can thank her dad Stephen for the marriage that came nine years later. She was first introduced to her future groom by her father, backstage at The Today Show. The teenagers just shook hands and said hello, but Hailey was a huge Belieber.</p><p>They kept in touch, as she was seen again two years later in a photo for his documentary Never Say Never. But it wasn’t romantic. Justin was dating <a href=#>Selena Gomez</a> at the time and they made their debut at the Vanity Fair Oscars After Party.</p><p>Then in 2014, when the pair broke up, Justin was seen near Hailey and pal Kendall Jenner attending church services at Hillsong. But months later, the model denied any romantic links between the pair, saying they were “good friends”.</p><p>It wasn’t until January 2016 when they went <a href=#>Instagram</a> official with a big smooch on the platform.</p><p>Although weeks later, Hailey called their relationship casual, saying they were not “exclusive”. While the Stuck With U hitmaker said she was “somebody I really love”. By August it was over, and he began seeing Sofia Richie.</p><p>They stopped talking for two whole years, which the star later says was good for them. <a href=#>Justin even got back with Selena</a> for a spell by the end of 2017. But they were over for good by the following March.</p><p>Two months later? Yep, they’re back on. They were seen sharing PDA at the LIV nightclub in Miami, and days later holding hands in New York City.</p><p>By July 2018, rumors were flying, so the songwriter told fans himself. Hailey and Justin Bieber were engaged, planning marriage. It wasn’t until November when they confirmed they did get married, with a second date to celebrate in August 2019.</p><p>The rest is history.</p><p>Related Topics</p><p>MORE CELEBRITY STORIES</p><span></span><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7pLHLnpmroaSuwaqwwaKrZ5ufonxzfJFtZmlrX2V%2BcLTAoqOesV2XtqauxKtkq52Robm6eceuqa1lmqrAtbXNZq6hnaKaeqmxjKucnKeeqLalsdGem2alkae%2Fqq3GnmY%3D</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./avocado-salad-with-carrot-ginger-dressing-2.html><span>←</span><span>avocado-salad-with-carrot-ginger-dressing</span></a>
