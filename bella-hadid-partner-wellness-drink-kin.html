Per Hadid's <a href=# data-vars-ga-outbound-link=https://www.instagram.com/p/CTSRrWSFIAL/ data-vars-ga-ux-element=Hyperlink data-vars-ga-call-to-action=posts class="body-link css-1gunp80 emevuu60">posts</a>, the drink is the first to "use adaptogens and focus on brain health, while expanding our mind and calming our nervous system."</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=2 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">Hadid announced her new venture through a series of Instagram posts, in which she described how she encountered the drink and its founder and CEO, Jen Batchelor, while she was dealing with chronic exhaustion and depression.</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=4 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">"The reason why I am coming on with Kin, is not only to consistently give you new formulas, creatives and products, but to also teach you about brain health and how we can help with the social, personal, physical, and mental pressures we face on a regular basis," Hadid shared.</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=6 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">In an interview with <a href=# data-vars-ga-outbound-link="https://www.vogue.com/article/bella-hadid-kin-euphorics?utm_source=pocket_mylist" data-vars-ga-ux-element=Hyperlink data-vars-ga-call-to-action=Vogue class="body-link css-1gunp80 emevuu60">Vogue</a>, Hadid opened up about her health, saying that she suffers from brain fog and exhaustion, the lingering effects of Lyme disease, and struggles with social anxiety. She also said that she doesn't drink much alcohol these days.</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=7 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">"I don't socially drink nearly as much as I used to. You can either take one shot of whiskey to feel better for 20 minutes or you can drink Kin every day to feel better for a lifetime," she said.</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=8 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">Hadid is the latest celebrity to invest in a beverage line—though, many celebs go for alcoholic drinks. Her friend Kendall Jenner launched 818 Tequila earlier this year, and rapper Post Malone started selling his rosé wine in the summer of 2020. We're now taking guesses on who will be the next millennial or Gen-Z star to start hyping their kombucha on Instagram.</p><span class="css-1s9owpq ev8dhu51"><img src="https://cdn.statically.io/img/hips.hearstapps.com/rover/profile_photos/81e105b4-86bd-4dab-a1f8-e00063b9e433_1609381211.file?fill=1:1&resize=120:*" alt="Headshot of Quinci LeGardye" title="Headshot of Quinci LeGardye" width=100% height=100% decoding=async style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center></span><p>Quinci LeGardye is an LA-based freelance writer who covers culture, politics, and mental health through a Black feminist lens.
