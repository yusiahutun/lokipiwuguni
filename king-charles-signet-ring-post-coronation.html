Sometimes known as ‘the gentlemen’s ring’, in recent decades women are just as likely to adopt the style. They are however still seen as a symbol of social standing, embodied by the etiquette of presenting a child on their 21st birthday with a signet ring of the family crest when they ‘come of age’ and have authority to use the crest."</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/images.hellomagazine.com/horizon/original_aspect_ratio/642ad013f91a-king-charles-signet-and-wedding-ring.jpg><p id=e8QlCjY6lIVk data-wc=60>Though Prince William is now Prince of Wales, it's unknown whether King Charles plans to pass on the signet ring like his Uncle did. It seems unlikely at present, firstly because Prince William does not like to wear jewellery – he does not even wear his wedding ring – and secondly, because the signet carries great significance to the monarch.</p><p id=eP9N52yi3g data-wc=16><strong>READ NEXT: </strong><a class=hm-link href=#>Royal wedding rings: The symbolic bands worn by Meghan Markle, Kate Middleton and more</a></p><p id=eTtE98UYH27p data-wc=37>King Charles chose to wear his Prince of Wales signet ring on his coronation day, proving its poignant meaning to him – can we expect to see it throughout his reign, too?
