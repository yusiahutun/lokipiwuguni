Inside a bee hive, there are 'rogue' members of the colony that appear to be indifferent to social instructions sent by their hive mates.
Rather than being sick or unintelligent, these insects may have a genetic condition that is similar to autism spectrum disorder, researchers have found.
The finding suggests that our instinct to crave company from others may be shaped by an ancient genetic toolkit that also drives the behaviour of social insects."><meta name=author content="Larita Shotwell"><link rel="preload stylesheet" as=style href=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/paper/css/app.css><link rel="preload stylesheet" as=style href=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/paper/css/an-old-hope.min.css><script defer src=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/paper/js/highlight.min.js onload=hljs.initHighlightingOnLoad()></script>
