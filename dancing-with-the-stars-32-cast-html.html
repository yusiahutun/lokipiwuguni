A replacement date has yet to be announced. The show, which was originally slated to premiere September 26, does have a WGA writer on staff and will be working in compliance with SAG-AFTRA guidelines, per GMA, another Disney offspring.</p><p class=clay-paragraph data-editable=text data-uri=www.vulture.com/_components/clay-paragraph/instances/clmtq9w6k000b3b7hbvh9531v@published data-word-count=162>For its part, SAG-AFTRA issued a statement in support of its members who are performing on the show. “Our members appearing on Dancing With the Stars are working under the Network Code agreement, which is a non-struck contract,” the statement reads. “They are required to go to work, are not in violation of SAG-AFTRA strike rules, and we support them in fulfilling their contractual obligations.” According to SAG-AFTRA, many cast members are legally required to return to the show “if the producer exercises their option which the producer has done.” The Network Code agreement also includes a “no strike clause” that prevents performers from striking until the agreement expires on June 30, 2024. “By not showing up to work, our performers can be held in breach of contract and the Union is prohibited from advising them not to work,” SAG-AFTRA said, noting that it stands “with our union siblings across the industry as we also recognize our obligations under federal labor law.”</p><p class=clay-paragraph data-editable=text data-uri=www.vulture.com/_components/clay-paragraph/instances/clmtjjy4l000f3b7hj7uput5l@published data-word-count=109>Whenever it does shuffle on back, DWTS, a beloved ABC institution, is ready to take on another of America’s most beloved cultural institutions: Romy and Michele’s High School Reunion. Next season’s cast was announced on<a href=#>Good Morning America</a> on September 13, and the Oscar-winning Mira Sorvino, who starred as Romy White, is among them. Despite a Matt Walsh on the lineup, no one will be more controversial than Jamie Lynn Spears, sister <a href=#>and enemy</a> of Britney Spears. Spears was confirmed to be joining the 32nd season of the show on September 12, according to <a href=#>The Hollywood Reporter</a>. We hope for her sake that some of <a href=#>that dancing ability</a> is genetic.</p><p class=clay-paragraph data-editable=text data-uri=www.vulture.com/_components/clay-paragraph/instances/clmhs4rzf000b3b80md0fp6cw@published data-word-count=163>On August 21, as part of the&nbsp;<a href=#>finale of&nbsp;The Bachelorette</a>, Charity Lawson, who just completed her reign, let us know she’s putting on her dancing shoes. She’s following in the footsteps of former Bachelorette and DWTS runner-up Gabby Windey — and we like Dotun well enough, but if Lawson wants to take it a step further and date a queer alt-comic, we’d recommend <a href=#>Celeste Yim</a>. She’ll be facing off against someone known for a slightly less fairy-tale-like reality TV relationship — Ariana Madix.&nbsp;<a href=#>Dancing With the Stars</a>&nbsp;mostly uses pretty classy dances, so we’re not sure if there’s any space to do the worm (with a mustache), but if anyone could fit it in, it’s Ariana. Madix, best known as the receiving end of the&nbsp;<a href=#>worst cheating scandal</a>&nbsp;to ever hit the cheating-heavy&nbsp;Vanderpump Rules, was the first star revealed to be competing&nbsp;DWTS&nbsp;on&nbsp;none other than Good Morning America&nbsp;on Friday, July 7. Below, find the entire list of the upcoming contestants — Veep fans, we expect a lot from you.</p><p class=clay-paragraph data-editable=text data-uri=www.vulture.com/_components/clay-paragraph/instances/clmhsexux000h3b80j0b0s246@published data-word-count=96>Barry Williams (The Brady Bunch) with Peta Murgatroyd<br>Matt Walsh (Veep) with Koko Iwasaki<br>Alyson Hannigan (How I Met Your Mother) with Sasha Farber<br>Mauricio Umansky (The Real Housewives of Beverly Hills) with Emma Slater<br>Harry Jowsey (Too Hot to Handle) with Rylee Arnold<br>Tyson Beckford (model) with Jenna Johnson<br>Lele Pons (social-media star) with Brandon Armstrong<br>Adrian Peterson (NFL) with Britt Stewart<br>Xochitl Gomez (Disney star) with Val Chmerkovskiy<br>Mira Sorvino (Romy and Michele’s High School Reunion) with Gleb Savchenko<br>Jason Mraz (singer) with Daniella Karagach<br>Jamie Lynn Spears (Britney nemesis) with Alan Bersten<br>Charity Lawson (The Bachelorette) with Artem Chigvintsev<br>Ariana Madix (Vanderpump Rules) with Pasha Pashkov</p><p class=clay-paragraph data-editable=text data-uri=www.vulture.com/_components/clay-paragraph/instances/clmtl6t5r000b3b7hiqg78u9r@published data-word-count=6>This post has been updated throughout.</p><h2 class=related-title data-editable=title>Related</h2><ul class=related-links data-editable=relatedItems><li class=related-link><span class=svg-wrapper></span><a href=# data-track-type=article-link data-track-component-name=related data-track-page-uri=www.vulture.com/_pages/cleyhkb4o00000igxao6hrag4@published data-track-headline data-track-component-title=Related><span class=headline>Every Detail of the Vanderpump Rules #Scandoval Drama in Chronological Order</span></a></li><li class=related-link><span class=svg-wrapper></span><a href=# data-track-type=article-link data-track-component-name=related data-track-page-uri=www.vulture.com/_pages/clh6c6rxi000i0icsjam4r9fg@published data-track-headline data-track-component-title=Related><span class=headline>Dancing With the Stars Foxtrots Back to ABC</span></a></li><li class=related-link><span class=svg-wrapper></span><a href=# data-track-type=article-link data-track-component-name=related data-track-page-uri=www.vulture.com/_pages/cllmao8gk00160ig16b1iymzg@published data-track-headline data-track-component-title=Related><span class=headline>The Bachelorette Season-Finale Recap: Treasure Island</span></a></li></ul><span class=ambrose-short-hed>Matt Walsh (No, Not the Conservative) Delays DWTS Appearance</span><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7t8HLrayrnV6YvK57wKuropucmnylrc2coKefXay2tbSMrZ%2BeZaOprrO%2FjGxpZpuRqMFvtNOmow%3D%3D</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./is-brendan-lemieux-related-to-mario-lemieux-family-links-explained.html><span>←</span><span>Is Brendan Lemieux Related To Mario Lemieux?
