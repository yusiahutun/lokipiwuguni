They discuss the latest happenings of the previous week, as well as memes, funny tweets and commentary from their fans.</p><p>This is where we got to see the Jason Kelce ‘hamcuzzi’ photo again, and it’s definitely a highlight of the past 7 days.</p><p>After Travis and the <a href=#>Kansas City Chiefs won the Super Bowl</a> – and enjoyed the kiss with <a href=#>girlfriend Taylor Swift on the field</a> – it may be easier to think nothing else will be worth watching until the season picks up again in the fall. But we were all wrong. Thankfully.</p><p>Travis says: “Our last Fan Mention from the Week comes from Chuck Knoll on Twitter, who posted an incredible photo of Jason [Kelce], let’s talk about the Hamcuzzi episode”.</p><p>The 36-year-old replies: “That Hamcuzzi episode, that was a long time ago, that is my rookie year I think? Jesus. Actually, that might be my second year for sure, that’s when I had the mustache.</p><p>“No, that’s all I got”.</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading id=h-travis-jokes-his-brother-is-psychotic>Travis jokes his brother is ‘psychotic’</h2><p>Travis then chimes in, upset he won’t talk about it anymore and asks him to at least explain the hilarious photo.</p><p>Jason Kelce adds: “It’s just eating a ham sandwich in a jacuzzi.”</p><p>“You get into the hot tub with a long sleeve shirt on,” Travis jokes, saying he’s “psychotic” for wearing a sweatshirt in the water.</p><p>Jason responds: “It’s a dry fit, there’s no world where you’ve seen a fat guy get in a poll with a shirt on?</p><p>“Well it does when somebody’s trying to take a picture of you.”</p><p>“Since when have you been ashamed of you r body?” The 34-year-old laughs.</p><p>“I don’t know,” Jason says. “I don’t know why I’m wearing that shirt, this happened over 10 years ago at this point</p><p>“I remember the ham sandwich was good and I remember I need to go in the jacuzzi with that thing. It looks toasted, it looks good.”</p><p>Jason then jokes people should get a ham sandwich and enjoy it in a hot tub “do yourself a favor”, before Travis interrupts with “or don’t”.</p><p>Here it is, to enjoy.</p><p>Related Topics</p><p>MORE CELEBRITY STORIES</p><span></span><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7pLHLnpmroaSuwaqwwaKrZ5ufonxzfJFtZmlqX2d%2FcLbArKanZZuauaSxjJyYp6xdp7KuscybnKtlmZi8r7XCZp%2BapZOqx7u1jJ6noqufmbJurtStZKGZo2KzsLrDZqSepZ%2Bntqa%2FjKidZpldna6uedKapZ2vmZi1cA%3D%3D</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./disgraced-drug-crusader-charged-for-threats-to-kill.html><span>←</span><span>Disgraced drug crusader charged for threats to kill | Free News</span></a>
