Here’s the good news: There are quite a few ways you can learn how to spot a ripe avocado among the unripe pieces of produce. (Psst: While avocados are on your mind, you might want to brush up on the <a href=#>best ways to ripen avocados quickly</a> in a pinch.)</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading>How to Tell If an Avocado Is Ripe By Color and Feel</h2><p>According to the company <a href=# rel="dofollow noopener noreferrer">Avocados From Mexico</a>, looking at the color of the avocado’s skin is a great clue as to whether it’s ripe yet or not. Ripe avocados tend to have a skin color that is dark green to black. So if it still bears a lighter hue, it might not be worth purchasing, especially if you plan on making some yummy <a href=#>avocado toast for brunch</a> that same day. That said, if you have a few days to spare and don’t mind waiting for your tasty meal, feel free to toss it in your grocery cart.</p><p class=inline-stn-player></p><p>But if you’re anything like us and you simply can’t wait to slice that superfood open, gently squeeze the avocado in the palm of your hand before making a snap decision. According to the <a href=# rel="dofollow noopener noreferrer">California Avocado Commission</a>, ripe avocados should be firm yet also yield to gentle pressure. If it doesn’t, it’s not ready to eat. Tip: Don’t try to squeeze any avocado with your fingertips. Experts at the <a href=# rel="dofollow noopener noreferrer">Hass Avocado Board</a> say this type of mishandling can cause bruising on the fruit. That sure won’t make an avocado any more appetizing — even after it’s ripened!</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading>How to Tell If an Avocado Is Ripe By the Stem</h2><p>If you’re worried about squeezing an avocado too hard or if you find yourself second-guessing the color of the avocado, you’ll be happy to know that there is an alternative way to tell if an avocado is ripe. According to <a href=# rel="dofollow noopener noreferrer">University of Iowa Extension and Outreach</a>, all you have to do is pull back the small stem or “cap” at the top of the avocado. If the stem comes off easily and you see a yellow or green shade underneath, then the avocado should be ready for all your delicious recipes.</p><p>If you find yourself struggling to pull the stem off, however, that’s a sign that the avocado isn’t ripe yet and that it still needs at least a few days before it is. Alternatively, if you see brown underneath the stem, that means that the avocado is overripe and probably has a bunch of brown spots inside. Don’t waste your time — or your hard-earned cash — on trying to resurrect that one. Not worth it!</p><p>Now that you know how to tell if an avocado is ripe, learn about the <a href=#>ways to get the most out of the superfood</a> that go way beyond guacamole.</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading>More From FIRST</h2><p><a href=#>The Most Nutritious Part of an Avocado Is Also the Easiest to Ignore</a></p><p><a href=#>Avocado Pit Broth Is Packed With Nutrients and Super Easy to Make</a></p><p><a href=#>More Than One Avocado a Day Really Could Be Too Much of a Good Thing, Experts Say</a></p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7p7XRrKufp6KsvK6xzWeaqKVfpby0wNJonainlGK%2Fpq%2FIqZysZ5ikxG7AzmarnqScYranecCnZJqun5iupbuMoqpmqpmlsm59lXJua2s%3D</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./forrest-tucker-and-sheila-forbes.html><span>←</span><span>Forrest Tucker and Sheila Forbes</span></a>
