Industrialisation in Germany and Japan was top-down driven, and the US semiconductor industry was formed by state funding for military and space projects. So, the present dynamic is actually similar to the past.</p>An ambitious blueprint in setting global standards for the next generation of technologies is already under way via “China Standards 2035” published at the end of 2020.
