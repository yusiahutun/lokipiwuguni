And while in some states they are slowly re-opening, in California, salons had to shut down for a second time, and are now prepping to provide <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=externalLink data-ordinal=1>outdoor services</a>.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_9-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">Although White House coronavirus response coordinator Deborah Birx, M.D. previously told InStyle that getting a manicure is considered low risk, I still feel safer doing my nails at home where there's no risk. So, with the help of <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=externalLink data-ordinal=1 rel=nofollow>Amy Lin</a>, founder of Sundays, and L.A.-based nail artist <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=externalLink data-ordinal=2>Brittany Boyce</a>, I learned how to safely apply, and remove, gel polish at home a few months ago.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_11-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">The only problem? The constant hand washing and handling of disinfectants were making my mid-length nails weak and brittle. I wanted to cut them all down and get a hard gel overlay, but that would mean a trip to the salon, which for the foreseeable future, is straight no for me, dawg.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_13-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">I knew there had to be an at-home option somewhere, so I started browsing through Orly's website for a solution. That's when I was reminded of the magic that is <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=externalLink data-ordinal=1 rel="sponsored nofollow">Builder in a Bottle</a> and knew I found exactly what I needed to get started.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_15-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">Usually, I would have consulted with a nail artist to guide me through the process. But this time I wanted to see if the product and instructions were easy enough to successfully apply on my own — without the help of a professional.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_17-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">But I won't spoil the result for you.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_19-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">Read on to find out how it all went down in five steps.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_21-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"><strong>VIDEO: The 10 Best Nail Polish Colors of Summer 2020</strong></p><span class=heading-toc id=toc-step-1-gathering-my-tools></span><h2 id=mntl-sc-block_25-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block instyle-sc-block-heading mntl-sc-block-heading"><span class=mntl-sc-block-heading__text>Step 1: Gathering My Tools</span></h2><p id=mntl-sc-block_26-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">I received <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=externalLink data-ordinal=1 rel="sponsored nofollow">Orly's GelFX Builder In A Bottle</a> Intro Kit as a press sample, which includes Builder In A Bottle, GelFX Nail Primer, GelFX Topcoat, two nail files, and a buffer — most of what I needed to get started.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_28-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">The only other tools and products to make sure to have on hand are some rubbing alcohol, a nail clip, a cuticle pusher, cuticle oil, cotton balls, an LED/UV light to cure your gel polish, and Orly's Fast Forms, which are the real MVPs (more on that later).</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_30-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">You also want to ensure that you have a cover over whatever hard surface you're working on.

However, whether you have on traditional lacquer or <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=internalLink data-ordinal=1>gel polish</a>, make sure to completely remove everything from your nails before starting to apply for gel extensions.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_41-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">Once I had a clean slate, I made the tough decision to completely <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=internalLink data-ordinal=1>cut my nails</a> down (it was for the greater good), then applied some oil to my cuticles and pushed them back. I also made sure the sides of my nails were pristine by removing any hung nails and dead skin. Then, I lightly buffed my nail beds using the gray nail file from the kit.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_43-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">Afterward, I poured 70% rubbing alcohol onto a cotton pad and wiped down my nail beds to remove any excess oil. I kept it close by for later.</p><span class=heading-toc id=toc-step-3-creating-the-extension></span><h2 id=mntl-sc-block_45-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block instyle-sc-block-heading mntl-sc-block-heading"><span class=mntl-sc-block-heading__text>Step 3: Creating the Extension</span></h2><p id=mntl-sc-block_46-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">Now here's where you need to start paying attention.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_48-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">After my nails had been prepped and cleansed, I opened up my box of Fast Forms. I made sure to find the correct size for each of my nails and laid them out in order before getting into the thick of things. Next, I applied the primer to each of my nails.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_50-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">Once I was done, I grabbed Builder in a Bottle and applied it to the inside of the Fast Form, not my nail directly, making sure to use less product at the base of the form. If you spread on too much in that area, your cuticles will flood. When I was ready, I applied the Fast Form to its assigned nail and cured it under the LED/UV light for 30 seconds. Ironically, I got my lamp for a little under $30 on Amazon.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_52-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">Once dried, I gently rocked and squeezed the forms to remove — then voila! But make sure to keep in mind that your extensions won't look flawless at first (mine sure didn't). You'll begin shaping them in the next step.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_54-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">When I finished each hand, I applied two more coats of Builder in a Bottle to each nail, curing for 30 seconds in between.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_56-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">Pro tip: It's a bit tedious, but for the best results, do one nail at a time. Depending on the size of my nails, I had to use my other fingers to hold down the Fast Form as it cured.</p><figure id=mntl-sc-block_58-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block instyle-sc-block-image mntl-sc-block-universal-image mntl-sc-block-image--no-theme no-theme mntl-sc-block-image figure-square figure-high-res"></figure><p id=mntl-sc-block_59-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"><strong>To shop: </strong>$37;<a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=externalLink data-ordinal=1> sunuv.com</a></p><span class=heading-toc id=toc-step-4-cleansing-shaping-and-filing></span><h2 id=mntl-sc-block_61-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block instyle-sc-block-heading mntl-sc-block-heading"><span class=mntl-sc-block-heading__text>Step 4: Cleansing, Shaping, and Filing</span></h2><p id=mntl-sc-block_62-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">Remember when I said I kept my rubbing alcohol handy? To move on to the next step, I first needed to cleanse my nail to get rid of the tacky residue most gel products leave behind.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_64-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">Like before, I poured some onto a cotton ball and wiped off the entire extension and the underside of the nail. Then I used a nail clip and file to mimic the same shape of my natural nails. But feel free to create whatever shape you prefer!</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_66-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">Once I was done, I gently buffed the extension, then cleansed it once more with the alcohol to prep for polish application.</p><span class=heading-toc id=toc-step-5-gel-polish-application></span><h2 id=mntl-sc-block_68-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block instyle-sc-block-heading mntl-sc-block-heading"><span class=mntl-sc-block-heading__text>Step 5: Gel Polish Application</span></h2><p id=mntl-sc-block_69-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">With a fresh, clean slate, I started with one coat of the GelFX Basecoat, then cured my nails for 30 seconds.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_71-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">While I normally aim for nude nails, this time I decided to follow up with two coats of Muy Caliente, a neon orange-red shade that I've recently fallen in love with. I cured it again for 30 seconds between each coat.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_73-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">Next, I finished off with the top coat from the Builder in a Bottle kit and cured it for 120 seconds. Once my nails were out of the lamp, I gave them one final swipe of alcohol, and I was good to go.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_75-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">Here's a little before and after for your viewing pleasure.</p><figure id=mntl-sc-block_77-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block instyle-sc-block-image mntl-sc-block-universal-image mntl-sc-block-image--no-theme no-theme mntl-sc-block-image figure-landscape figure-high-res"></figure><p id=mntl-sc-block_78-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">So the answer is yes, you can do your gel extensions <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=internalLink data-ordinal=1>at home</a> — it's truly not as hard as you may think.
