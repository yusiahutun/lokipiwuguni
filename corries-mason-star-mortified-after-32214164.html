I was in the gym and, I don’t know if this is TMI but, obviously I’m getting changed to go in the sauna and you have to take your pants off.</p><p>“And I was there, butt naked, and I hear someone say, ‘Oi Mason’. And he’s like, ‘Oh you’re a baddun’ and I’m just sat there like [stunned].</p><p>“But I think it’s all tongue and cheek, like people aren’t stupid.

He went on: “I do understand to a certain extent because I think we all do it whenever we’re watching TV or movies, like we actually hate that character.</p><p>“But I think it’s a step further to then go online and start [being mean], do you know what I mean? So, I do understand, I completely get it and with a show like Corrie, it’s so consistent and it’s so close to life [that it’s easily done].</p><p>“It’s not like I’m in Star Wars, its stuff in Manchester. So sometimes people do [mistake me for Mason] but for the majority, it’s just tongue in cheek.”</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/s2-prod.mirror.co.uk/@trinitymirrordigital/chameleon-branding/publications/dailystar/img/logo-schema-dailystar.png><p>It comes after fans watched Liam contemplate taking his own life on the soap in order to end Mason’s constant torment both inside and outside the school grounds. Viewers will have to stay tuned to see whether or not Mason will face the cold hand of justice or not.</p><p><b>Coronation Street airs on Mondays, Wednesdays and Fridays from 8pm on ITV1 or catch up on ITVX.</b></p><p><b>Want all the biggest Showbiz and TV news straight to your inbox?</b><a data-content-type=section data-link-tracking=InArticle|Link href=# rel="noreferrer noopener"> <b><u>Sign up for our free Daily Star Showbiz newsletter.</u></b></a></p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7pa3IpbCsrJGne6S7ja6iaKymZLCwvtGinKxlnZbAsLqMrKuaql2ivLPAyJ%2BgnpxdlrO1sdFmamtqYWl%2Bd4A%3D</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./blake-shelton-cassadee-pope-danielle-bradbery-nye-video.html><span>←</span><span>Blake Shelton Joined by 'Voice' Winners on NYE [Watch]</span></a>
