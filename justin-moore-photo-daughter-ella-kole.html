"Me and Ella tearin up some largemouths!" he <a href=#>tweeted</a>, including the pic of his little one helping her old man hold two fish of her same size.</p><p>When Moore isn't out on the water, he's splashing around on stage. His fishing rendezvous yesterday sits between shows in Ohio and Oregon, where he's set to play on May 29.</p><p>But just because the country singer is touring doesn't mean he can't be a full-time dad to his baby. Now that she's big enough, she gets to visit him when he's making tour stops. "I'll get to see her a lot more this year, and she'll be old enough to where she can get out and walk around," he tells <a href=#>Taste of Country</a>. "We can take her out to the zoo and all that kind of stuff in different towns."</p><p>Fishing included. For more Moore, catch the Arkansas native live when he joins <a href=#>Rascal Flatts</a> on tour this summer.</p><p><strong>See Justin Moore Perform 'Small Town U.S.A' on Stage With Ella Kole</strong><br></p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmiskajBprvFnKaupqSnxm%2BvzqZmo62jqbavecyopqudXaW1sMDOZpuarZedwaa%2BjJ6jpZldoLytsY4%3D</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./elin-nordegren-married.html><span>←</span><span>Estimated Age &amp;amp; Net Worth 2023 of Elin Nordegren; Who are Elin Nordegrens Kids?</span></a>
