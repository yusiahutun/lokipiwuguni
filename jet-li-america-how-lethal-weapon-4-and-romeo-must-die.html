He said, ‘we just want your style.’Jet Li</figure><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">Li decided not to use wirework<strong data-qa=ContentSchemaRender-defaultRenderMapFunctions-Component-1 class="css-1mniedq eq9i94316">,</strong> and the martial arts scenes mainly feature some well-executed close fighting which makes good use of Li’s skills in the fast and aggressive xingyi quan martial arts style.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">The fight staging veers towards the US style of action, utilising swift cuts to different camera angles, but Li’s prowess at martial arts is clearly visible on screen.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">Li says the action scenes worked because the director, action veteran Richard Donner, let him choreograph his own scenes, and also hired Yuen and other martial arts experts from Hong Kong to work on the film.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/cdn.i-scmp.com/sites/default/files/d8/images/canvas/2021/11/12/df18a62b-6ea3-48ee-bf21-f3cb6cc35390_0b64b9bd.jpg><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">“I asked Richard Donner if he wanted me to fight the US way, or the Hong Kong way. I told him that the two ways were very different, and if he wanted my kind of action, he had to give me freedom to work,” Li commented.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">“He said, ‘we just want your style.’ So it was great, because I could bring my people over to help choreograph the scenes.”</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">Gibson reportedly said he liked the way Li fought, and Li could beat him up any way he liked on set, although he was warned not to actually hurt Gibson.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">The film’s racist slurs – there is a running “flied lice” joke and various other insults – were noted by Hongkongers at the time, as was the vicious nature of Li’s character, Wah Sing Fu. Wah is fully evil and is given no decent qualities to humanise him – he even punches out a pregnant woman.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/cdn.i-scmp.com/sites/default/files/d8/images/canvas/2021/11/12/d2a4c82a-2e6a-4c12-9839-11800a40dd58_de680aef.jpg><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">“I am just an actor and I follow the script,” Li noted when questioned about the negative portrayal of Asians in the film.</p><h3 type=h3 data-qa=Component-Component class="e14khtrb0 css-17x7qa9 e793b7w1">Romeo Must Die (2000)</h3><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">African-American audiences have a lot to do with the success of martial arts films in the US – black viewers were the first American fans of the genre in the early 1970s.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">Producer Joel Silver, who had worked with Li on Lethal Weapon 4, tried to capitalise on this connection with 2000’s Romeo Must Die, an adaptation of Shakespeare’s Romeo and Juliet which set Li and the late R&B singer Aaliyah in a vaguely realised romance against the backdrop of a gang war between black and Chinese gangsters.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">Silver packed the soundtrack with tracks by DMX, Timbaland, and others. The press junket for the film, held in New York, even featured a set by Aaliyah at a nightclub together with Li and DMX, to push the point home.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">Silver doubled the number of Li’s fight scenes – there are eight, as opposed to the four in Lethal Weapon 4 – and thought the film would elevate Li to leading-man status.</p><h3 type=h3 data-qa=Component-Component class="e14khtrb0 css-17x7qa9 e793b7w1"><a class="link-text css-e0dnmk ef1hf1w0" href=# data-qa=BaseLink-renderAnchor-StyledAnchor><p><span data-qa=DigitalArchiveLink-TitleText class="css-66qo9a eeeqn932">Jet Li’s 10 best films ranked, from Shaolin Temple to Fearless</span></p></a></h3><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">But its convoluted story, which was based on a 10-year-old script that originally pitted Italian-American gangsters against Japanese yakuza, is messy, and relegates Li to being just one player among many.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">What’s more, the action scenes, choreographed by Li, Corey Yuen and the same Hong Kong and US team from Lethal Weapon 4, suffer from an attempt to fuse unrealistic- looking wirework with down-to-earth American-style action. The sequences are edited so quickly that Li’s martial arts moves are not clearly visible.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">A modernised version of a scene in Lau Kar-leung’s magnificent Dirty Ho, in which Gordon Liu’s deceptive hero used Kara Hui Ying-hung’s body like a marionette to ward off an attack, is one of the best scenes. Li uses Aaliyah in a similar way to kill a female assailant, because he doesn’t want to fight a woman himself.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/cdn.i-scmp.com/sites/default/files/d8/images/canvas/2021/11/12/72152ac3-969d-427b-aa49-947129f558c3_4599f744.jpg><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">A segment in which Li quickly adapts to the rigours of American football is also fun to watch, although even this suffers from some incongruous wirework that looks out of place amid the more grounded fighting styles of the American characters.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">A nasty special “X-ray” effect which showed the bones of Li’s victims breaking and crushing – the effect was reported to be Li’s idea – also disappointed martial arts fans, as it made the star seem brutal and removed the grace from the combat scenes.</p>Li took note of all the criticisms, and decided to revert to a more grounded form of fighting for his next Hollywood film, <a class="euc41pk0 e13op9j60 e1qbu6wp1 css-jgjyn2 ef1hf1w0" href=# data-qa=BaseLink-renderAnchor-StyledAnchor><span data-qa=Component-Text class="css-0 e1qbu6wp0">The One</span></a>.<img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/cdn.i-scmp.com/sites/default/files/d8/images/canvas/2021/11/12/9b24d393-1e6b-4863-b897-e1f930c0d0c7_04abb65a.jpg>In this regular feature series on the best of Hong Kong martial arts cinema, we examine the legacy of classic films, re-evaluate the careers of its greatest stars, and revisit some of the lesser-known aspects of the beloved genre.
