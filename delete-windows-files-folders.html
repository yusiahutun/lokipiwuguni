Between hidden caches, old junk that wastes space, and files you can delete to solve problems, knowing what's safe to remove from Windows can be challenging.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Let's step through some Windows files and folders that are safe to remove, along with why you might want to erase them. This will help you free up disk space and learn more about your PC.</p><p>Some of these folders are in system-protected locations, so take care when deleting them.</p><h2 id=the-best-way-to-clean-windows-folders-disk-cleanup-or-storage-sense>The Best Way to Clean Windows Folders: Disk Cleanup or Storage Sense</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static1.makeuseofimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/Windows-10-Disk-Cleanup.png><p>Before we look at Windows files and folders you can safely remove, you should know that manually deleting them isn't usually the best way to go about it.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Aside from wasting time doing this yourself when you could automate the process, it's safer to let the Disk Cleanup tool do these cleanings for you. This helps you avoid <a href=#>common Windows maintenance mistakes</a>, like accidentally deleting files that you need or messing with the wrong folders.</p><p>The Disk Cleanup tool helps you <a href=#>reclaim disk space on your Windows computer</a> and is simple to use. You can open it by searching for <strong>Disk Cleanup</strong> in the Start menu and selecting a drive (<strong>C:</strong> in most cases). Let it scan, and you'll see several categories of files you can erase. For more options, choose <strong>Clean up system files</strong> and provide administrator permissions before you go through the list.</p><p>If you find this interface too clunky, you can browse to <strong>Settings > System > Storage</strong> to try the newer storage cleanup tool in Windows 10 and 11. Click <strong>Temporary files</strong> in the list of options, then you'll see a list populate that's similar to what Disk Cleanup offers.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong> <img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static1.makeuseofimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/Windows-10-Storage-Sense-Temporary-Files.png><h3 id=what-to-delete-from-disk-cleanup>What to Delete From Disk Cleanup</h3><p>This isn't a full guide to the Disk Cleanup tool, so we're not going to look at every entry in the menu. However, the following options are low-hanging fruit (make sure to select <strong>Clean up system files</strong> first to see them all):</p><ul><li><strong>Windows Update Cleanup:</strong> This erases old copies of Windows Update files. These are safe to delete in most cases, but if you run into update-related issues, you should keep them for troubleshooting.</li><li><strong>Windows upgrade log files:</strong> Similarly to the above, these are data files that Windows Update stores to help you dig into problems concerning upgrades or installations. You can erase these if you haven't had errors related to upgrading Windows to a new version.</li><li><strong>Language resource files:</strong> If you've previously downloaded another language or keyboard layout that you don't use, this will let you easily erase it.</li><li><strong>Recycle Bin:</strong> While you can empty the Recycle Bin through its own window, you can also do it easily here. Just make sure there's nothing inside it that you need.</li><li><strong>Temporary files:</strong> As their name suggests, temporary files aren't used for anything in the long term, so you can erase them without worry.</li></ul><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Now, let's look at what you can delete from Windows 10 and Windows 11 safely. Usually, these files are on your <strong>C:</strong> drive, but you might find them elsewhere if you have multiple storage disks and have installed Windows with custom options.</p><h2 id=the-hibernation-file>1. The Hibernation File</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static1.makeuseofimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2023/03/windows-disable-hibernation.jpg><p><strong>Location: C:\hiberfil.sys</strong></p><p>Hibernation mode on your PC is similar to sleep mode, except the system saves all your open work to the storage drive and then shuts down. You can remove the battery from your laptop and stay in hibernation for a week, then start back up and pick up right where you left off.</p><p>Of course, this takes up space, which is what the hibernation file is for. Depending on your storage drive's size, the hibernation file is likely several gigabytes or more.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>If you don't use hibernation and want to disable it, you can easily do so via the command line. Note that <a href=#>you shouldn't just delete <strong>hiberfil.sys</strong></a>, as Windows will recreate it again.</p><p>Instead, right-click on the Start button or press <strong>Win + X</strong>, then open a <strong>Command Prompt (Admin)</strong>, <strong>Windows PowerShell (Admin)</strong>, or <strong>Windows Terminal (Admin)</strong> window from the resulting menu. Type the following command to disable hibernation:</p><pre><code class="hljs bash">powercfg.exe /hibernate off</code> </pre><p>That's all it takes to disable hibernation. Windows should delete <strong>hiberfil.sys</strong> on its own when you do this; feel free to delete it after if not. Note that disabling hibernate mode will also prevent your computer from using fast startup in Windows 10 and 11. However, this isn't much of a loss, as this feature is known to <a href=#>cause slow Windows boot times</a> and other problems.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=windows-temp-folder>2. Windows Temp Folder</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static1.makeuseofimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2023/03/windows-temp-folder.jpg><p><strong>Location: C:\Windows\Temp</strong></p><p>As you'd guess from the name, Windows temporary files aren't important beyond their initial use. The files and folders inside contain info that Windows used at one time, but doesn't need anymore.</p><p>Instead of cleaning via Disk Cleanup, you can visit this folder and delete its contents manually, if you prefer. Just press <strong>Ctrl + A</strong> to select everything inside, then hit <strong>Delete</strong>. Windows might give you an error about a couple of items when you do this—just ignore those and clear everything else.</p><p>This folder will fill up with new items over time, which is a normal part of Windows' operation.</p><h2 id=the-recycle-bin>3. The Recycle Bin</h2><p><strong>Location: shell:RecycleBinFolder</strong></p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>The Recycle Bin is a unique folder—while it appears under your <strong>C:\</strong> drive, this is protected by Windows and you don't need to access it that way. Whenever you delete a file on your system, Windows sends it to the Recycle Bin. This is a special place where deleted files are kept until you permanently delete or restore them.</p><p>While this might be obvious to you, we're including it in case some aren't aware. It's easy to forget that several gigabytes of old data can sit in your Recycle Bin.</p><p>You can access the Recycle Bin through the shortcut on your desktop. If you don't see that, type <strong>shell:RecycleBinFolder</strong> into File Explorer's navigation bar. Once here, you'll see everything you've deleted recently. Right-click on individual items and click <strong>Delete</strong> to permanently erase them, or choose <strong>Restore</strong> to send a file back to its original location.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>On the top Ribbon's <strong>Recycle Bin Tools</strong> tab, you'll see buttons to <strong>Empty Recycle Bin</strong> and <strong>Restore all items</strong> at once. To tweak the way the Recycle Bin works, click <strong>Recycle Bin properties</strong> (which may be under the <strong>three-dot menu</strong>).</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static1.makeuseofimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2022/11/Enable-or-Disable-Delete-Confirmation-Dialog-via-Recycle-Bin-Properties.jpg><p>In this dialog, you can change the maximum size of the bin, or even choose <strong>Don't move files to the Recycle Bin</strong>. With this option, Windows skips the bin and permanently removes items when you delete them.</p><p>We don't recommend this, because the Recycle Bin gives you a second chance in case of accidental deletion. Similarly, <strong>Display delete confirmation dialog</strong> will require an extra step whenever you erase a file.</p><h2 id=windows-old-folder>4. Windows.old Folder</h2><p><strong>Location: C:\Windows.old</strong></p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Whenever you upgrade your version of Windows, the system keeps a copy of your prior files, called <strong>Windows.old</strong>. This folder essentially holds everything that made up your old installation, in case something didn't transfer correctly.</p><p>If necessary, you can use this folder to roll back to a previous version of Windows. It's also possible to open the folder and grab a few stray files if you need them.</p><p>Windows automatically removes this folder a short time after upgrading, but you can remove it yourself if you're crunched for space. It won't delete if you try to go through File Explorer, so to erase it from your drive properly, type <strong>Disk Cleanup</strong> into the Start Menu and launch the tool as described earlier.</p><p>Click <strong>Clean up system files</strong> at the bottom of the window and let the utility do another scan. Once that's done, look for the <strong>Previous Windows installation(s)</strong> and delete it using this tool.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>As you'd expect, removing these files makes it harder to recover data and <a href=#>troubleshoot Windows in case of an issue</a>. After performing a Windows upgrade (even just to the latest version of Windows 10 or 11) we advise you to hold onto this folder until you're sure everything is working properly.</p><h2 id=downloaded-program-files>5. Downloaded Program Files</h2><p><strong>Location: C:\Windows\Downloaded Program Files</strong></p><p>This folder's name is a bit confusing; it doesn't have anything to do with apps you've downloaded. Instead, it holds files used by Internet Explorer's ActiveX controls and Java applets—the intent is that once you use one of these features on a website, you won't have to download it twice.</p><p>In effect, this folder is useless today. ActiveX and Java are effectively extinct on the modern web, and <a href=#>Internet Explorer is no longer supported</a>. Thus, your <strong>Downloaded Program Files</strong> folder might already be empty (or not even exist), but feel free to clean out the contents if it's not.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=livekernelreports>6. LiveKernelReports</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static1.makeuseofimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2023/03/windows-livekernelreports-folder.jpg><p><strong>Location: C:\Windows\LiveKernelReports</strong></p><p>The LiveKernelReports folder is another directory that likely comes up when you're scanning for large files on your computer. This folder is home to dump files, which are ongoing information logs that Windows keeps. If your computer runs into an issue, you can <a href=#>analyze the contents of log files with Event Viewer</a> to start troubleshooting your problem.</p><p>Any huge files ending with the <strong>DMP</strong> file extension in this folder are safe to delete if you don't need to look deeper into them. Like the above locations, though, we recommend using Disk Cleanup instead of deleting the file yourself.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>When Windows crashes or you have other major computer problems, don't delete these dump files right away. You can use a program like <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">WhoCrashed</a> to get more info from them.</p><h2 id=rempl-folder>7. Rempl Folder</h2><p><strong>Location: C:\Program Files\rempl</strong></p><p>While the <strong>Rempl</strong> folder isn't large, you might be surprised when you see it appear on your system. It contains several small files, and you might even notice a few Task Manager processes connected to it.</p><p>This folder is connected to Windows 10 and 11's update delivery. It includes "reliability improvements" to help make Windows updates go smoothly and iron out compatibility issues.</p><p>So can you delete the <strong>Rempl</strong> folder? There are seemingly no adverse effects from doing so. However, since it only takes up a few megabytes and can make Windows upgrades less frustrating, it's best to keep it around.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=the-windows-files-you-can-safely-delete>The Windows Files You Can Safely Delete</h2><p>It takes a bit of looking around to find them, but your computer holds plenty of files and folders that aren't necessary. Remember that your modern versions of Windows do a pretty good job of keeping themselves clean, so you don't have to constantly purge the contents of these folders unless you're dangerously low on disk space.</p><p>Running the Disk Cleanup tool once a month should do enough to keep the cruft away. If you still need to free up a lot of space, try uninstalling some unnecessary Windows software.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7rq3KnqysnZ%2Bbe6S7zGirmp9fmbKtsdOeZLChnpm8uL%2BMn6ClnaNis7C4w56prGc%3D</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./chicago-fire-star-taylor-kinney-inside-lavish-home-photos.html><span>←</span><span>Chicago Fire star Taylor Kinney's lavish home revealed after dramatic house blaze</span></a>
