This year, I’m giving away home-made preserves.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">In an ideal world, we would work with whatever fruits are grown locally and available fresh but, in Hong Kong, we often have to rely on what’s being sold at a reasonable price in the frozen-fruit section. Keep your eyes peeled for good deals on unusual fruits – this year, I was pleased to find frozen lingonberries.</p><p datatype="p" class="c1 e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31" id=U10935179325FcB data-qa=Component-Component><strong data-qa=ContentSchemaRender-defaultRenderMapFunctions-Component-0 class="css-1mniedq eq9i94316">Cooked lingonberry preserves</strong></p><p datatype="p" class="c2 e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31" id=U10935179325r9 data-qa=Component-Component>Researching lingonberries after finding bags of them in the frozen-food section at Great, in Pacific Place, Admiralty, I learned that the fruit is nutritious and high in pectin. I also learned that in Scandinavian countries, the simple way to make lingonberry preserves is to just mix the fruit with sugar, stirring occasionally until the sugar dissolves – there’s no need to cook the mixture before putting it into jars. I used some of the lingonberries that way, but also made a batch with the usual technique of cooking the fruit and sugar together. The simpler technique better retained the fresh flavour of the fruit – but it needs to be refrigerated, which isn’t good if you’re giving it as a gift. If you want to make it this way, use a fruit to sugar ratio of 2:1.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">For cooked lingonberry preserves, simmer the mixture briefly. If you overcook it, the jam will get too thick, and the fruit will end up tasting more like cranberries, to which lingonberries are related. This jam doesn’t use as much sugar as most of my preserves recipes (I usually use 4:3) so the tart flavour of the fruit is preserved. It also makes it a delicious preserve for serving with savoury dishes, as is done in Scandinavian cuisines.</p><p datatype="p" class="c3 e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31" id=U10935179325WUC data-qa=Component-Component>1.5kg frozen lingonberries<br>750 grams granulated sugar, divided</p><p datatype="p" class="noindent e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31" data-qa=Component-Component>Put the lingonberries in a large bowl and mix in half the sugar. Leave for several hours (or overnight), stirring occasionally, until the sugar is dissolved.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">Just before cooking the jam, wash eight to 10 250ml can­ning jars and their lids. Fill the jars with boiling water, leave for five minutes, then pour out the water and leave the jars inverted in a draining rack. Put the lids in a bowl, cover them with boiling water and leave until it’s time to fill the jars.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">Put the fruit mixture into a large, wide pan. Add the remaining sugar and 250ml of water, then bring to the boil over a high flame, stirring often. Simmer until most of the lingonberries burst. Ladle the mixture into the sterilised canning jars, leaving 1cm of headspace. Wipe the lip of each jar with a damp paper towel then cap it with the lid and screw it on tightly.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">To make the preserves shelf-stable (so there’s no need for refrigeration), boil them in a water bath. Bring a wide, deep pot of water to the boil and lay a dish towel on the bottom so the base is completely covered. Put the jars upright in one layer in the pot of water, making sure they are submerged. Bring to the boil then lower the heat and simmer for 10 minutes, adding more water, if needed. Remove the jars from the water and leave to cool.</p><p datatype="p" class="c4 e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31" id=U10935179325s0B data-qa=Component-Component><strong data-qa=ContentSchemaRender-defaultRenderMapFunctions-Component-0 class="css-1mniedq eq9i94316">Wild blueberry preserves</strong></p><p datatype="p" class="c2 e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31" id=U10935179325xI data-qa=Component-Component>Wild blueberries are smaller than the cultivated variety, and seem to have a higher amount of pectin.

Put the fruit mixture into a large, wide pan. Add the remaining sugar and bring to the boil over a high flame, stirring often. Cook, stirring almost constantly, until the jam reaches its setting point: check by turning off the flame then putting some of the jam on the chilled plate. Leave for a few minutes, then run your finger through the jam on the plate: if your finger leaves a track mark, the jam is ready. If it’s too thin, turn the flame back on and continue to cook the mixture, checking the consis­tency occasionally. When it’s ready, stir in the lemon juice.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">Ladle the mixture into the sterilised canning jars, leaving 1cm of headspace.

Split the vanilla beans in half lengthwise, scrape out the tiny seeds, then put the seeds and scraped-out pod into the pan, along with the cinnamon sticks. Add 300ml of water then bring to the boil, lower the heat and cook at a very low simmer for about 90 minutes, or until the apples are tender. Increase the heat and cook, stirring often, until the sugar is caramelised and the mixture is thick. Stir in 350ml of water then bring to the boil, turn off the heat and leave for 30 minutes. Bring to the boil again, turn off the heat and leave for a further 30 minutes. By this time, most of the apples should be translucent.
