I’m taking the shortest of breaks from blasting Folklore on repeat to hit you with a bit of Swifty-approved style inspo. Not sure what I mean? I’m talking about all of Taylor Swift‘s incredible Folklore fashion choices, of course! With one promo photoshoot, album cover and music video, Swift has me buying tons of new pieces for my wardrobe, from cardigans (duh) to vintage-inspired nightgowns to lacy-sleeved sundresses.
If you’re as big a Folklore fan as I am, you’ve no doubt watched the “Cardigan” music video tons of times—and if you watched during the midnight premiere, you might’ve been cozied up in your own old, worn-in pajamas, wondering why you didn’t look nearly as cute as Swift in her vintage white nightie.</article><article class=post-entry><h2>Georgia beauty queen Trinity Poague, 18, is seen in her mugshot after being charged for the murder o</h2><time>Mar 12, 2024</time>

Not all monochrome looks are created equal. When I wear head-to-toe black, no one is complimenting me on my cool outfit or asking me where I got my jeans. But some monochrome ensembles are effortlessly stylish, and the monochrome look Issa Rae rocked outside Good Morning America&nbsp;was one of the best I’ve ever seen.

This Barbie is a Hollywood icon. Margot Robbie made her arrival at the 2024 Oscars tonight in a striking black gown from Versace’s Fall/Winter 2024 ready-to-wear collection. The shimmery piece featured a dramatic rounded strapless neckline and an elegant layered molten detail at the waist. Robbie wore it with Manolo Blahnik pumps and, for some extra sparkle, accessorized with a twisty silver and gold cuff.

The actor’s decision not to wear Barbie pink to Hollywood’s Dolby Theatre—and instead to opt for a sleek black dress—may be her own version of the “revenge dress” Princess Diana’s famously wore in 1994, after then-Prince Charles publicly admitted to cheating on her.</article><article class=post-entry><h2>Who is Leo Blakstad dating?
