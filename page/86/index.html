Long before the fame, glitz, and glamour, Johnny Cash, aka The Man in Black, was an ordinary guy, doing ordinary things and getting by with his own life.
What many people do not know about the country music icon is that he did not have the privilege to go to music school or even play any instrument until well into his teenagehood.
John R. Cash joined the military as a last resort to make a life for himself, but this was not the career that really lit him up.</article><article class=post-entry><h2>Best Themed Airbnb Rentals For Adults 2024</h2><time>May 19, 2024</time>

Jack Kerouac, tra le pagine del suo On the Road, non ha dubbi: “Mi resi conto all’improvviso che mi trovavo in California. Caldo, aria balsamica – un’aria che si poteva baciare − e palme”. Sono questi gli elementi che più colpiscono il padre della Beat Generation; con i suoi paesaggi e una vita dal sapore diverso, la California lascia spazio all’immaginazione e alla creatività di chiunque voglia lasciarsi ispirare. Oggi Los Angeles è sempre più un punto di riferimento nel panorama culturale del mondo; non a caso Design Miami, una delle maggiori fiere del settore, da quest’anno terrà un’edizione proprio nella Città degli Angeli, che va ad aggiungersi a Miami, Basilea e Parigi come tappa della rassegna.</article><article class=post-entry><h2>John Corbett Returning to Parenthood</h2><time>May 19, 2024</time>

Bees that are antisocial may have a genetic condition similar to human autism, research suggests.
Inside a bee hive, there are 'rogue' members of the colony that appear to be indifferent to social instructions sent by their hive mates.
Rather than being sick or unintelligent, these insects may have a genetic condition that is similar to autism spectrum disorder, researchers have found.
The finding suggests that our instinct to crave company from others may be shaped by an ancient genetic toolkit that also drives the behaviour of social insects.</article><article class=post-entry><h2>Chris Hemsworth's Trainer Says You Only Need to Workout for 5 Minutes a Day</h2><time>May 18, 2024</time>
