During the film, the audience gradually learns about An’s hardships, such as having to pretend to be disabled so her parents could be granted permission by authorities to have a second child in the years before China lifted its one-child policy in 2015.&nbsp;
The film was created by two women, director Yin Ruoxin and screenwriter You Xiaoying. Both of them have explored Chinese family dynamics in their previous works.&nbsp;
You, the screenwriter, told&nbsp;The Beijing News&nbsp;that, even though she is a single child, the idea for the film stems from experiences her friends shared when China allowed births of a second child in 2015.</article><article class=post-entry><h2>Justified Recap: Throwing the Bullet</h2><time>May 23, 2024</time>

I recently went to Victoria’s Secret, where a 20-something sales associate named Sydney with a blond ponytail, a perky attitude, and a tape measure asked me if I knew my correct bra size.
“Yes,” I said, because my natural tendency is to eschew help when shopping in malls.
“What is it?” she asked — somewhat aggressively, I thought, for a 20-something with an innocent-looking blond ponytail.
I thought back to the last bra I had purchased: a cute and sexy bra-and-panty set from L’Agent, the more affordable offshoot of Agent Provacateur, founded by Penelope Cruz.</article><article class=post-entry><h2>Harry Potter and the Philosopher's Stone by J.K.

Equally big news was that Li, who had only ever played heroes like Wong Fei-hung in Hong Kong films, was to play a bad guy. “Jet Li’s first role as a villain has put him on the ‘it’ List. But will it launch a Hollywood career?” this journalist wrote at the time.Li was certainly not new to the United States. He had moved there in the mid-1980s, after his first burst of fame with the Shaolin Temple series had subsided, and even made two films in the country, albeit not for Hollywood producers – The Defector, and the Tsui Hark-directed The Master.</article><article class=post-entry><h2>Rick Leventhal and Kelly Dodd Defend 'Alec Baldwin' and 'Native American' Halloween Costumes</h2><time>May 22, 2024</time>
