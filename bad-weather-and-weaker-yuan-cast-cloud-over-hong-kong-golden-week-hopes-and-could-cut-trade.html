Immigration officials predicted a week before the start of the mainland holiday that the first day would see peak travel at land border crossings, with a million trips in and out of the city on May 1 alone."><meta name=author content="Martina Birk"><link rel="preload stylesheet" as=style href=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/paper/css/app.css><link rel="preload stylesheet" as=style href=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/paper/css/an-old-hope.min.css><script defer src=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/paper/js/highlight.min.js onload=hljs.initHighlightingOnLoad()></script>

city on May 1 alone.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">The city was expected to have 5.9 million arrivals and departures over the golden week period.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">“We shouldn’t be looking only at the quantity of tourists,” Lee said. “The spending patterns have changed.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">“On top of this, mainland tourists might not necessarily come to Hong Kong – those who have spending power might choose to go to Hainan or overseas to Thailand and Japan.”</p>Rainbow Ma Sau-ying, the general manager at Pak Loh Chiu Chow Restaurant, which has branches in the popular tourist areas of Mong Kok and Causeway Bay, said she was not confident about increased business from <a class="euc41pk0 e13op9j60 e1qbu6wp1 css-jgjyn2 ef1hf1w0" href=# data-qa=BaseLink-renderAnchor-StyledAnchor><span data-qa=Component-Text class="css-0 e1qbu6wp0">tourism</span></a> over the holiday.<p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">“The mainland tourists coming to Hong Kong are not necessarily the big spenders,” Ma said. “Locals these days have made spending across the border a habit, so it’s an unknown whether business will improve.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">“The rainy weather might play a part as well.”</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">She predicted a worse financial performance this year relative to last year’s holiday, with a 20 to 30 per cent drop in business.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">She said her restaurants, which specialise in cuisine from Chiu Chow, Guangdong province, were offering value set meals to help attract diners.</p><h3 type=h3

data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">Harbour Fun Restaurant and Bar, which offers a range of Western and Japanese dishes, also said it was not optimistic about business over the holiday.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">The restaurant, on the Wan Chai promenade, will command an unobstructed view of a spectacular Victoria Harbour fireworks display on May 1 and offer a special menu at HK$560 (US$72), but its manager was still not confident that it would be booked out.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">“Our restaurant filled up previously when there were fireworks displays,” said the manager, who only gave the surname Ma. “But now, because the government has announced more frequent fireworks displays, they are no longer as attractive.”</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">A 10-minute fireworks display at 8pm over Victoria Harbour is designed to be a highlight to kick off golden week.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">Ma added that the forecast of rain for the day of the fireworks also put a cloud over business prospects.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">He said he expected a drop of 30 per cent in takings compared with the last Labour Day golden week.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">He was also unsure whether his restaurant would benefit from the arrivals and urged the government to promote the Wan Chai promenade more to attract not only mainland tourists, but also visitors from overseas.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">Michael Leung Chun-wah, the owner of the Lucky Dragon Palace Restaurant, said the influx of mainland visitors could potentially benefit establishments in tourist areas but not those elsewhere.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">“Our restaurant is based in Ngau Chi Wan in a housing estate,” Leung said. “The droves of tourists in Hong Kong will not come all the way to us to eat, so they won’t be of help to our business.”</p><h3 type=h3 data-qa=Component-Component class="e14khtrb0 css-17x7qa9 e793b7w1"><a class="link-text css-e0dnmk ef1hf1w0" href=# data-qa=BaseLink-renderAnchor-StyledAnchor><p><span

data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">William So Man-sing, the general manager of London Restaurant, a dim sum house in Mong Kok, said it would be “extremely fortunate” if business was as good as it had been in previous May holidays.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">So said the bad weather, the university exams season and the Hong Kong public’s preference to travel to Shenzhen had all contributed to a downturn in business.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">He added that predicted bad weather could also mean tourists would rather stay put and look after their homes and families as rain hit the mainland.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">“We can never compete on price with the mainland,” So said.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">“The important thing is to deliver quality and service, as well as highlight what they can’t taste on the mainland.”</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">Tourism minister Kevin Yeung Yun-hung on Sunday warned visitors to be “mentally prepared” for last-minute changes to the holiday fireworks display schedule.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">“We may not know whether the evening fireworks show will be affected until the afternoon of May 1, as it is a rain issue,” he said.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">“We hope that tourists coming to Hong Kong will be mentally prepared … that some performances may not be able to be held.”</p><p class=postsid
