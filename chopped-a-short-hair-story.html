<span>Reinaldo Massengill</span></p><h1>Chopped: A short hair story</h1></header><section class=post-content><p>Back in July I was lounging around our beach house reading InStyle with Anne Hathaway on the cover when I had a revelation.<br>“I want to cut my hair short,” I proclaimed aloud to my sister.<br>“Like how short?”<br>“Like to here…” and illustrated the length that came just below the nape of my neck.<br>“I think you’ll miss it.”<br>“I think I want to do it.”<br>Accustomed to my whims, my sister ignored me. She probably thought I’d get bored with the idea, realize that I love my long hair and let it go.<br>But I am impulsive to a certain point. The next day on the beach I called my salon to make an appointment.<br>“Thank you for calling the <a href=# rel=nofollow>James Joseph Studio.</a>”<br>“Hi I need to make an appointment for a cut and color.”<br>“Ok…”<br>*Extended pause where I was supposed to say when I wanted to come in*<br>“Wh-what time would you like to come in?”<br>Oh God. Did I really want to do this? I’d been growing my hair for so long!<br>*Deep breath* “I’ve been growing my hair out since 2003 and I want to cut it short so I really need someone who is experienced with cutting long hair into short hair and I need someone who is nice. And cool.” *exhale*<br>“Ok hon. Well Kylene is really good. And she has an opening on Tuesday at 6pm.”<br>“Perfect!” I hung up the phone and basked in the sun, my ponytail drooping over the beach chair.<br>“Oh, honey, I’m glad you’re gonna cut your hair.” That was my mother, The Donna. The Donna hates long hair. When I was in second grade she had my hair chopped to boy short length. When I went into&nbsp;school the day after my hair slaughter, the kids asked me if I had a sex change operation over night because I looked like a boy. I cried for a month straight.</p><p>Related Stories</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/stylecaster.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/03/DVFxtargetreview.png> <img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/stylecaster.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/03/askawitch_question4_FI.jpg> <span class="mt-enclosure mt-enclosure-image" readability=2><img decoding=async alt=chopped.jpg src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static-dailymakeover.stylecaster.com/2015/03/chopped.jpg height=226 width=219 style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center><p><span>Dance recital circa 1986. My sister (L)<br>and I (R) rocking out our bowl cuts.</span></p></span><p>My childhood had been a series of bowl cuts and/or close cut crops. If you look at Polaroids of me you can’t really tell if I’m a boy or a girl. I always imagine the awkwardness strangers must have felt when they came up to me, saw me with my short hair and dressed in a white shirt and brown corduroys and not knowing what gender I was. Sort of when you see a newborn baby dressed in yellow. You ask the parents, “What’s its name?” I often wonder if my mother ever got that when&nbsp;I was around.<br>I tried to get into the long hair phase but then the curse of Friends arrived and everyone was getting the “Rachel.” Caving to peer pressure, I too instructed my hairdresser to give me the Rachel. Little did I realize that I had a round face and hair&nbsp;that mushroomed in the humidity and not a personal hair stylist to fix it for me. The Rachel shag was a disaster and I vowed that I would never cut my hair again. Until my senior year of college. Again, on another whim I went to a random salon and the guy cut my hair into the shape of a football helmet. That’s when I really vowed to never cut my hair short again. Until now.</p><p>Tuesday rolled around. I walked into the studio and immediately felt at ease. Kylene was my age and really cool.<br>“Ok so, you want to cut your hair to about here?” Her hands hovered above my shoulders.<br>“Yes. But not a bob. I cannot have my hair be in a bob, do you understand?<br>She laughed. “Got it. No bobs.”<br>“Mmmmkay thanks.”<br>“Ok. I’m just going to sort of rough cut it.”<br>“Ok…”<br>She put my hair into a little pony tail and *CHOP*<br>“Holy ****!” I exclaimed<br>I looked down and saw scattered pieces of my long dark chestnut hair all over the hard wood floor. Oh dear God. What had I done?<br>She had me turned away from the mirror and I constantly tried to strain my neck to see what she was doing and she constantly had to snap my head back into place.<br>“I’m sorry. I’m not trying to be a pain in the ass. It’s just…I just… ”<br>“It’s ok.”<br>“Ok…but please…just don’t make it too short. I don’t want to look like I have a mushroom hat on.”<br>She laughed. “You’re fabulous.”<br>We were in the middle of talking when she flung me around to face the mirror.<br>“Well? What do you think!?”<br>“AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAH!!!!”<br>I clapped my hand over my mouth.<br>“OHMIGOD. It’s SO SHORT!!!”<br>“I think it looks amazing. It’s so chic!”<br>“It’s so short!”<br>I reached to the back of&nbsp;my&nbsp;head and all I felt was air. My hand had to travel a little further up to above my shoulders before I reached actual hair.<br>She started the blow dryer&nbsp;and I immediately started to cry. (I had always heard stories of girls who cried after they cut their long hair short and always thought how stupid that sounded. Now I TOTALLY got it.) and texted everyone I knew to tell them that I had just chopped off four inches of&nbsp;my hair and that I was crying.<br>I thanked Kylene for dealing with me and assured her that I loved it even though I felt like I was on the verge of a nervous breakdown.<br>I walked out of the salon&nbsp;very self aware of my neck and shoulders. I was so used to the thick mane of dark brown hair acting as a security blanket that I started to freak out. I called a friend and asked if I could stop by to borrow her hair straightener. When she opened the door she shrieked and said how much she loved it and her boyfriend concurred. After a while of staring at myself in the mirror I began to love it and couldn’t believe that I had my hair that long for all that time.<br>As you can imagine, my mother was thrilled.&nbsp;</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmirpK65pq%2FArKueql6YvK57wZ6YrqypZK%2BmrdStsGhtaGuBcX6OnJ%2BoqKCasW6tjKyfqKqkYrWitdFmqq2noq58</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./bella-hadid-partner-wellness-drink-kin.html><span>←</span><span>Bella Hadid Has Become a Partner in a Wellness Drink Brand</span></a>
