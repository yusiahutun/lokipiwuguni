Below are short prayers you can say.</p><ul><li>Almighty God, my friend is about to undergo a very delicate surgery. Just thinking about the operation makes me very worried about their well-being. Lord, I trust that You are sovereign. You are in control of this situation. My friend’s life is in Your hands. I ask that You surround me with Your peace that I may not worry too much and that You also touch my friend with Your powerful healing hands.</li><li>Redeemer, today, my friend is facing surgery that makes him/her feel anxious and afraid. I ask for Your protection as s/he enters the surgery room and the doctors work on his/her body. Please guide the surgeons' hands as they perform the task set before them. Give them wisdom in every decision they make and help him/her to rely on You for strength during this period.</li><li>Jehovah, I surrender my loved one to You today. Thank You for the gift that they are to me. I trust You are in control over everything and that You will be in the surgery room with them when I cannot.</li><li>Lord Almighty, today, my loved one is going in for surgery. Help me to support them well in every step of the process and be a reflection of Your unconditional love to them during this time. Thank you for bringing them into my life and for the constant reminder of Your love.</li><li>Heavenly father, I commit my loved on into Your hands as they prepare to go into surgery. Thank you so much for all of the fun times we have shared and for the joy they bring into my life. Please take care of them while I am separated from them for a little while. Heal whatever is ailing them and guide the doctor’s and nurse’s hands to skillfully, carefully, and quickly do what they need to do. Amen.</li><li>I commit the life of my loved one to You, Jehovah. You are the author of life, and You are the ultimate healer. Take good care of them, God, as they are going under the surgeon’s knife. Take away whatever it is that is negatively affecting their body. Be with the surgeon, too, Jesus, as he performs this delicate operation. Enable him to do no harm to my loved one’s body. Direct his hands during the entire course of the surgery. Allow him to locate the site of the disease and remove it. As he cuts the flesh open and patches it back up afterwards, let his hands be gentle as a feather. Let no damage be done on my loved one’s body. Amen.</li><li>Father, we submit to your will whatever the outcome. Let Your will be done. Provide full recovery with no problems or long-term complications. Pour out the power of Christ for the grace and faith we need in this. Let your guardian angels carefully watch over us now. Amen.</li><li>Jesus, be close behind my dear friend today. Whisper words of hope and compassion within her/his heart. Shut out the fear, worry and pain that beset her/his mind. Wrap her/him in your soft, merciful love. As the surgeons begin their work, bless their efforts and bring healing to my friend’s body. Please continue to protect her/him and keep her/him in your care. May they feel your presence and be consoled during their suffering. Amen.</li><li>You strengthen those who are weak and tired. Through your power, you can heal the sick. I ask that you protect my friend as her/his surgery begins today. Help her/him to be healed and guide the surgeons as they begin their work. Amen.</li><li>You are the light of the world and the source of everlasting peace. Bring my friend peace and comfort as the surgery begins through your power. I pray that you will protect and keep her/him in your care as the surgeons begin their work. Please help my friend to make a safe, healthy recovery from her/his surgery. Amen.</li></ul><a class=c-article-read-also__image-wrapper href=#><img sizes=256px style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/netstorage-tuko.akamaized.net/images/54befd88cac5756b.jpg></a><a class=c-article-read-also__headline href=# readability=29><p class=c-article-read-also__caption>Read also</p><p class=c-article-read-also__headline-wrapper><span class=c-article-read-also__headline-hover-inner>St. Francis prayer for animals that are sick, lost, or dead</span></p></a><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/netstorage-tuko.akamaized.net/images/3c6826c819134c4a.png><h3 id=425055-encouraging-words-for-someone-having-surgery class=table-of-contents__scroll-section>Encouraging words for someone having surgery</h3><p class=align-left>Words of encouragement boost people's confidence in what they are about to do or go through.
