It starts with the backstory: After seeing his sister, Mabel Williams, mix coal and Vaseline to enhance her eyes, Maybelline New York founder Thomas Lyle Williams became inspired to embellish the eyelashes (his sister and her Vaseline trick were also the inspiration behind the brand’s name). One of the brand’s first products in his mission: Great Lash. But no one at the brand anticipated Great Lash to be the success it was and still is today, 50 years later.</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=6 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">“Great Lash established the brand as an authority in mascara, and that continues to be the case today,” Jessie Feinstein, senior vice president marketing at Maybelline New York, says.</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=7 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">The icon status is largely due to its formula. When Maybelline created Great Lash in 1971, most mascaras used wax as a base. Instead, Maybelline made the first water-based mascara, which makes removal a breeze (this becomes widely adopted among other brands). Plus, the innovative formula didn’t sacrifice volume.</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=8 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">While the Lilly Pulitzer–inspired tube makes the mascara widely recognizable, that’s only part of Great Lash’s appeal. “It’s accessible and relatable,” Feinstein adds, noting that Great Lash is still Maybelline’s most affordable mascara. “We’ve seen it used throughout generations of women, from your grandmother to your sister, but also by makeup artists and in turn celebrities.”</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=9 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">Although half a century old, Great Lash continues to stand out among hundreds of mascaras lining the shelves of beauty aisles. It also continues to a be a “first” for many girls and women just starting their mascara collections and wanting to enhance their eyelashes—which is just what Williams intended.</p><h6 class="css-ok56rr e94w1mj3"><span aria-hidden=true class="css-0 eagam8p0"></span><span class="css-8lle59 e94w1mj1">Related Story</span><span aria-hidden=true class="css-0 eagam8p1"></span></h6><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7qa3RqZyrq5KWx6Kt0WeaqKVfl7KiwdOyZqaZm5rCsXvAbG5wbmFofnF7zJqwm52cobavsYynnLBlqaS%2FrHnGq5yarF2hrrS0jKKaqKZdqMGwvtho</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./joseph-tomanelli-killed-plane-crash-son-survives-html.html><span>←</span><span>Joseph Tomanelli killed in plane crash, son survives</span></a>
