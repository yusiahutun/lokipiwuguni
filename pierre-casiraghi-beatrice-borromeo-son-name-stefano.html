Pierre's father tragically died in 1990 as a result of a sailing accident. Much like his first name, Stefano's other names have ties to family origins. Ercole, which is Hercules in Italian, was the name of a 16th century lord of Monaco's son, Hercules Grimaldi. Meanwhile Carlo is a recurrent name in Beatrice's noble Italian family as well as the name of her father Don Carlo Ferdinando Borromeo.</p><p class=p1 style=text-align:center id=ejCa0CB_TQSA><span><strong></strong></span></p><p class=p1 style=text-align:center id=eJuEWR01SXHI><strong></strong></p><strong class=fr-embedded><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/images.hellomagazine.com/horizon/original_aspect_ratio/8a77a4875e4e-pierredad-z.jpg></strong> <strong>Pierre's father died in a sailing accident</strong><p class=p1 id=e14rY52MZX_u data-wc=102><a class=hm-link href=#>HELLO! reported on Tuesday that Pierre and his wife had their first child</a>. Rumors of the baby's arrival began swirling after Beatrice's sister posted to (now deleted) mysterious message on Instagram. Attached to a scenic photo of a marina, Matilde Borromeo wrote, "28/2/2017 new date to add in the calendar for my family," adding several blue heart emojis. Princess Caroline later confirmed the birth of her fourth grandchild in a joint statement with Beatrice's mother, Countess Donna Paola Marzotto. "The Princess of Hanover and the Countess Paola Marzotto have the joy of announcing the birth of their grandson born on 28 February 2017. The mother and the child are doing well," the statement read.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/images.hellomagazine.com/horizon/original_aspect_ratio/db3d5d206d1c-gettyimages-468005728-z.jpg><p class=p1 style=text-align:center id=edKSQAx67yWE data-wc=9><strong>The couple welcomed their first child on February 28</strong></p><p class=p1 id=ej8IAZVvwuvq data-wc=68><strong>HELLO! </strong>confirmed back in November that Beatrice was pregnant. Last March, the 31-year-old opened up about her desire to have children. She told Glamor magazine, "I come from a big family, and I want children of my own." Though at the time she noted, "But at the moment I'm thinking about putting my career in a place where it would not get threatened by the presence of children."</p><h2 class="newsletterTitleClass_nlzr60o hm-heading">Sign up to HELLO Daily! for the best royal, celebrity and lifestyle coverage</h2><span class=newsletterDisclaimerClass_ncg5smk><p>By entering your details, you are agreeing to HELLO!
