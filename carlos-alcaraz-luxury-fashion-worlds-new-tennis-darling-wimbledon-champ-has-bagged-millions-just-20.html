According to Vogue, he grew up in a small village called El Palmar outside Murcia. Forty years ago, his great uncle built a tennis club and his grandfather Carlos joined the business venture. This love of tennis was passed on to Alcaraz’s father, also named Carlos, who played professional tennis in the early 1990s. Unfortunately, he eventually had to give it up because he lacked funding.</p><h3 type=h3 data-qa=Component-Component class="e14khtrb0 css-17x7qa9 e793b7w1"><a class="link-text css-e0dnmk ef1hf1w0" href=# data-qa=BaseLink-renderAnchor-StyledAnchor><span data-qa=DigitalArchiveLink-Topic class="css-1wyvcgo e1b1x8aa3"></span><p><span data-qa=DigitalArchiveLink-Title class="css-i31uou e1b1x8aa1">How to pull off Kendall Jenner’s elegant courtside casual look this summer</span></p></a></h3><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">“Carlitos”, as his family likes to call him, got his first tennis racquet at the age of 4. His three siblings – Alvaro, Sergio and Jaime – all have a keen interest in tennis and have competed at some level, too.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/cdn.i-scmp.com/sites/default/files/d8/images/canvas/2023/07/19/c57acd27-fba8-4bf2-85d0-64bce42fc3fa_c9a394c6.jpg><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">Carlito’s family recognised his talent and tried to plan a trip overseas for a world championship under-10s competition. Per The Guardian, the family did not have the money for the trip and tried to find sponsors. They eventually turned to a good friend who worked at a confectionery company to help them with finances. The trip was pricey but when Carlitos reached the finals, the sponsor agreed to fund future competitions too.</p><h3 type=h3 data-qa=Component-Component class="e14khtrb0 css-17x7qa9 e793b7w1"><strong data-qa=ContentSchemaRender-defaultRenderMapFunctions-Component-0 class="css-1mniedq eq9i94316">Keeping a low profile</strong></h3><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/cdn.i-scmp.com/sites/default/files/d8/images/canvas/2023/07/19/6c8fcc86-2e60-4768-922b-d709e4069985_a26c17fe.jpg><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">Although he made history in 2022 after becoming a grand slam champion at the US Open and the ATP’s first ever teen No 1 at 19 years old, Alcaraz insists he keeps his life simple.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">He regularly returns home, telling Vogue that he enjoys chilling with his friends at the park or playing board games at their house. The sporting champ is a keen chess player, explaining that the strategy that goes into the game is similar to that of the tennis court.</p><h3 type=h3 data-qa=Component-Component class="e14khtrb0 css-17x7qa9 e793b7w1"><a class="link-text css-e0dnmk ef1hf1w0" href=# data-qa=BaseLink-renderAnchor-StyledAnchor><span data-qa=DigitalArchiveLink-Topic class="css-1wyvcgo e1b1x8aa3"></span><p><span data-qa=DigitalArchiveLink-Title class="css-i31uou e1b1x8aa1">6 celebrity kids with extravagant luxury watches, from Rolex to Richard Mille</span></p></a></h3><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/cdn.i-scmp.com/sites/default/files/d8/images/canvas/2023/07/19/88e8224c-a8a6-4a1d-89cd-e4faa44cb218_77e70e99.jpg><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">Although his bank balance has changed dramatically, he said he leaves his father to “sort it out”. With the world at his feet at such a young age, he could easily fall into a lifestyle of partying and luxury. But the tennis star has worked with a psychologist to not only help with his past “aggressive” tendencies on the court, but to overcome stress while playing, per Essentially Sports.</p><h3 type=h3 data-qa=Component-Component class="e14khtrb0 css-17x7qa9 e793b7w1"><strong data-qa=ContentSchemaRender-defaultRenderMapFunctions-Component-0 class="css-1mniedq eq9i94316">Big earnings</strong></h3><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/cdn.i-scmp.com/sites/default/files/d8/images/canvas/2023/07/19/0fd79256-8a67-49bc-8200-13b4669694dc_a26c17fe.jpg><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">According to Tennis Majors, Alcaraz has made more than US$13.7 million on the ATP Tour in singles and doubles combined.

I don’t really pay much attention to brands and cars. If I like something, I try to buy it, but in the end my father takes care of everything.”</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/cdn.i-scmp.com/sites/default/files/d8/images/canvas/2023/07/19/d78b981f-7f4f-493f-9067-dee0de8653f8_a26c17fe.jpg><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">At the same time, he does love Nike trainers.
