We converted the barn full of tractors and equipment into a beautiful wedding space...and our back porch into an enchanted forest," she captioned a post on social media, showing off details of the tastefully executed decor.</p><p>Indeed, as Brittany herself admitted, the results were gorgeous, with the couple’s enormous estate providing a perfect venue for a romantic and lovely evening</p><p>Adding to the visual treats was the addition of her 2-year-old son Memphis, who dressed up in his very first formal wear to see his uncle take a walk down the aisle, as his mom adoringly documented.&nbsp;Aldean’s brother-in-law <a href=#>Chuck Wicks</a> officiated the wedding, according to&nbsp;Brittany’s post.</p><p>Brittany’s younger brother, Hunter Kerr, is by her own words, "Actually the best friend that I think I’ve ever had," and the two do appear to have always been very close. She transferred from the University of Alabama in her junior year to attend the University of North Carolina at Charlotte, where Hunter was a freshman, and famously went on to cheer for the NBA’s Charlotte Bobcats.</p><p>Of course, the Aldeans are no strangers to romance themselves; the country superstar and the former&nbsp;<a href=#>American Idol</a>&nbsp;contestant married in 2015 in a gorgeous Mexican destination wedding.&nbsp;They welcomed Memphis in 2017, followed by daughter Navy in 2019. Aldean also has two older daughters, Kendyl and Keeley, from his first marriage.</p><p>The couple have&nbsp;spent several years planning and building their dream home in Tennessee, and they&nbsp;<a href=#>finally moved in</a>&nbsp;on June 13, 2020. They've been sharing photos of the jaw-dropping mansion ever since...and it appears they are putting it to good use, as it is hard to imagine a more beautiful or elegant place for anyone to tie the knot.</p><p><strong>WATCH: Jason Aldean Talks About His New House + Album:&nbsp;</strong></p><p><strong>See Pictures of Jason Aldean's Amazing New Mansion:&nbsp;</strong></p><p><strong>See Pictures of Jason Aldean's Previous Fairytale Mansion:</strong></p><p><strong>See Inside Jason Aldean's Other Amazing Rural Retreat:</strong></p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmiskajBprvFnKaupqSnxm%2BvzqZmo5mjpLturtGiq62Znq56orjDnpinZZikwLV5waumraCVp8Buw8Sdm6Kml2K1trrTnqlmo5Wnv3A%3D</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./why-2023-was-the-year-of-the-status-drinking-vessel.html><span>←</span><span>From designer water bottles to Stanley cups, why 2023 was the year of the status drinking vessel</span></a>
