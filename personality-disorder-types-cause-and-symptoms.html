It also involves the behaviour that makes it difficult for an individual to succeed in interpersonal relationships. Personality defines well who we are as individuals. Our personality is a unique blend of traits, including attitude, behaviour, thoughts and perception. It also shows how we express these traits when we interact with others. Our personality traits also reflect our manners while communicating with others. These traits allow people to flexibly adapt to their changing environment that leads to the development of further healthy connections with others and better managing strategies.</p><p>People with less adaptive personality traits lead them to inflexibility and unhealthy coping. They find it difficult to trust and socialize with other people. Personality forms early in human life. It is shaped through a blend of our Genes and Environment. Our parents may pass down some personality traits to us and sometimes these traits are known as temperament. The environment includes our surroundings, events that have happened to us, relationships and patterns of interactions with our family members, friends and others. People diagnosed with personality disorder often find it hard to understand emotions and tolerate distress. They rarely adapted to a certain situation or environment. This makes it difficult for them to relate to others, causing serious issues and affecting their family life, social exertion, work and overall quality of life.</p><h4 class=wp-block-heading>Who gets personality disorder?</h4><p>Anyone can get a personality disorder, but different types of personality disorders affect people differently. Most personality disorders begin in the teen years when our personality further develops and matures. Almost all people diagnosed with personality disorders are above the age of 18. There’s no clear reason why some people develop the passions and behaviours associated with personality disorders and others don’t. Researchers believe that a mix of factors seems to increase the risk of developing these experiences including environment and social circumstances. According to DSM-5, features of a personality disorder usually begin during adolescence and early adulthood. In earlier versions of the DSM, a personality disorder could not be diagnosed under age 18, however, DSM-5 allows now this diagnosis if the features have been present for at least one year.</p><p>Also Read: <a href=#>What Is Borderline Personality Disorder And Importance Of Empathy Towards People Suffering?</a></p><h4 class=wp-block-heading>Types of personality disorder</h4><h5 class=wp-block-heading>Paranoid personality disorder and Schizoid personality disorder:</h5><p>A person having paranoid personality disorder is extremely suspicious and distrustful and, always thinks that other people are lying to them.
