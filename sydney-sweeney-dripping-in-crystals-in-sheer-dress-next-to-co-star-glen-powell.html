She dazzled in the flashing camera lights as it hugged the curves of her body.</p><p>The dress was accessorized with a black belt under her bust, while her blonde locks were up in a neat bun. Her makeup was a neutral-toned glam that complimented her gown.</p><p>Glenn Powell stepped out alongside <a href=#>Sydney Sweeney</a> and was out to impress with his outfit too. The 35-year-old donned a navy blue suit with a white T-shirt and black dress shoes.</p><p><strong>MORE:</strong> <a href=#>Movie star John Malkovich suffered four tragedies and lost his life savings in just 5 years</a></p><h2 class=wp-block-heading id=h-a-co-star-love-affair>A co-star love affair?</h2><p>Over the past few months, there have been rumors swirling that Sydney Sweeney and Glen Powell were having an affair on set, despite having partners. The <a href=#>TV</a> actress is engaged to Jonathan Davino, while Glen was with Gigi Paris until earlier this year. Their split didn’t help the cheating rumors.</p><p>They have batted away romance claims numerous times while doing press for their film. But they’ve denied it over and over again.</p><p>Glen <a href=# rel=nofollow>told</a> Men’s Health: “When all that stuff happened, you know, publicly, it felt disorienting and unfair. But what I’m realizing is that’s just a part of this gig now.”</p><p>Sydney, however, seemed more accepting of the rumor pool. She embraced the rumors where it came to her <a href=#>movie</a> co-star.</p><p>“It’s a rom-com. That’s what people want! Glen and I don’t really care. We have so much fun together, and we respect each other so much,” she <a href=# rel=nofollow>told</a> Variety.</p><p>The <a href=#>celebrities</a> seemed quite cozy yesterday (November 11) when the pair were interviewed on the Red Carpet. Glen Powell claimed he and Sydney Sweeney “loved each other” when the interviewer said that the pair had “chemistry.”</p><p>Despite giggles between the pair, Glenn <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">told</a> Hoda Kotb that there was nothing romantic between them.</p><p>He explained: “No, but we do love each other. And, honestly, this is one of the most spectacular humans I’ve ever met. She’s really great.”</p><p><strong>MORE: </strong><a href=#>Golden Globes 2024: The Barbenheimer battle isn’t over yet</a></p><p>Related Topics</p><p>MORE CELEBRITY STORIES</p><span></span><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7pLHLnpmroaSuwaqwwaKrZ5ufonxzfJFsZmpqX2Z%2FcL%2FYnaWesV2oxKaxzZ6wZpyinr2xtc2gZKKmXZi%2Fur%2FTmqOsZZmjerS0xJ6pZpyimsC0ec2er61lpKR6pLuMrKuaql2cuaa6jKmmsJ2coXw%3D</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./justified-recap-season-3-episode-8-html.html><span>←</span><span>Justified Recap: Throwing the Bullet</span></a>
