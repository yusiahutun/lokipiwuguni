She added, "I have not drank since that day. I do not plan on drinking ever again. I want to try to do something positive to make a difference, speak out about this and warn others about the dangers that come with drinking."</p><p>During the sentencing hearing, one of the victims' sisters asked the judge to impose the maximum sentence possible, 28 years -- and said Melgoza "destroyed multiple families with your selfishness" and has "zero consideration" for others.</p><p>The deadly crash happened on April 10, 2022 and the aftermath of the accident was caught on police body camera footage.</p><p>The video, released by the Tazewell County Sheriff Department, began with Melgoza telling police she was the one who called 9-1-1, before referencing her college by exclaiming, "I go to Bradley, why would this happen to me?"</p><p>After admitting to having marijuana in her car, she told authorities she was driving when "suddenly, one person walked out in front of me" and her "car got hit." It was then she called the police. "I promise you, I only know one person got hit. They came out of nowhere. I am a safe driver," she said, after being told there was a second victim.</p><p>She told police she was going about 40mph and told them she had "about three drinks" of vodka at the bar before getting in her car. "Right now, If you had me do a test, I think I would pass. Don't test me, but I think I would pass," she told them, as the officer on the scene told her they would very likely be giving her a breathalyzer due to the circumstances.</p><p>On a scale of 1-10, 10 being the most drunk she's ever been in her life, Melgoza said she was a 5. "I've been very drunk," she said, "right now, I see you, I see everyone, I know I'm aware of everything."</p><a class="article-block__link js-track-link" href=# data-node-ref=toofab:article:2cea53ac-49d4-4030-a308-be3d723c6be8 data-container-ref=toofab:article:bd071a92-43ff-4582-a05b-a79ccbc194ea data-context='{"section":"article-block","name":"article"}' readability=28><img src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/images.toofab.com/image/37/5by4/2023/04/25/37019db5b1b645b4a255ea20780291e2_xs.jpg width=300 height=240 style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center> <span class="media-credit article-block__media-credit">TikTok</span><p><h4 class="article-block__card-title article-block__card-title--has-credit">Viral Video Shows Arkansas Man Laugh In Disbelief As Four Cops Arrest Him For Piercing Son's Ear</h4><span class=article-block__cta-text>View Story</span></p></a><p>She was seen laughing during the field sobriety eye test -- exclaiming how "hard" it was to keep still -- before struggling to comprehend how to do the walking and balance tests. "I can't do it, sir, I really can't," she told police, before then reportedly blowing three times the legal limit on the breathalyzer.</p><p>At that point, she was placed in handcuffs and placed in the back of a police cruiser -- again denying she hit two people. As she arrived at the hospital, she said, "If it was two, I'd be crying. I'd be like, 'Oh my god, I did this. I know what I did.'"</p><p>In the exam room while waiting to be checked and treated for injuries, she then began talking about how excited she was to go to Las Vegas for her birthday ... and starting her trip by drinking two Long Island iced teas. The officer in the room with her asks, "You ain't had enough of drinking already?"</p><p>She then tells the officer he's being too quiet, so she starts singing out loud and dancing in the hospital bed, before asking whether she can get her car back to go to school the next day.</p><a class="article-block__link js-track-link" href=# data-node-ref=toofab:article:98071754-600c-4d4c-bc68-5b7b19991543 data-container-ref=toofab:article:bd071a92-43ff-4582-a05b-a79ccbc194ea data-context='{"section":"article-block","name":"article"}' readability=29><img src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/images.toofab.com/image/cf/5by4/2023/04/07/cf2899a0f955476ba1a190b7108cba6a_xs.jpg width=300 height=240 style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center> <span class="media-credit article-block__media-credit">Volusia Sheriff's Office</span><p><h4 class="article-block__card-title article-block__card-title--has-credit">Wild Bodycam Video Shows Arrest of Naked Florida Man Covered In Grease, Peppermint Oil and Blood</h4><span class=article-block__cta-text>View Story</span></p></a><p>"Your car is totaled. Wrecked. You don't," he said, something she just simply couldn't understand. "I don't go to school tomorrow, is what you're telling me?" she then asked.</p><p>"No ma'am. You want me to be honest with you? You're going to jail. You don't have a bond. You killed two people tonight. Your car is property of the police department, because it's a crime scene," he told her. "You killed two people tonight. You are clueless with that, clearly, I've already explained this to you."</p><p>"So, no, you're not going to school tomorrow," he added.</p><p>None of that seemed to get through to her either, as she then asked him, "Can I go Tuesday for my night class?"</p><p>Frustrated with the situation, he exclaimed, "Did you just hear what I just told you? Did you hear what I said?"</p><p>"You're on body camera being completely careless about killing two people tonight," he added. "You could care less, that's sad and pathetic, and horrible all at the same time."</p><p>She expressed some shock over his comments, asking if he was allowed to say that to her "as a cop." His response: "Yes, ma'am, I can." As she began to express concern about her classes and professors, he said he was more concerned about the two people who were killed that evening. The video ends with her once again singing to herself.</p><p>Melgoza still graduated from Bradley, but <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">reportedly</a> was not allowed to walk in the graduation ceremony due to student backlash.</p><a class="article-block__link js-track-link" href=# data-node-ref=toofab:article:f929fd6b-bd0f-41a1-b8a8-023f36ee94f9 data-container-ref=toofab:article:bd071a92-43ff-4582-a05b-a79ccbc194ea data-context='{"section":"article-block","name":"article"}' readability=27><img src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/images.toofab.com/image/62/5by4/2023/04/05/6209270cbbc4474aa553be79e923416f_xs.jpg width=300 height=240 style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center> <span class="media-credit article-block__media-credit">Pinellas County Sheriff's Office / GoFundMe</span><p><h4 class="article-block__card-title article-block__card-title--has-credit">2-Year-Old Boy Found in Alligator's Jaws After Mother Stabbed Over 100 Times</h4><span class=article-block__cta-text>View Story</span></p></a><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmisn6Szoq6NnKamZ2Jlf3R7j25maWtfqMGmvMeapaKdXaKyrbPOs5hmaWRixqat0axkn5mklrlusNSiZJunlK6wormO</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./met-gala-guest-list-2024.html><span>←</span><span>Whos Invited to the Met Ball This Year?</span></a>
