Piece by piece, they reveal the essentials they deem worthy of living in their Chanel Flap Bag rent-free. While they may be entertaining, I always find these videos incredibly unrelatable. My daily bag is a <a rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow" href=#>Longchamp Le Pliage tote</a> and it serves as a portable storage unit for my work computer and every other miscellaneous item that doesn’t comfortably fit into my one-bedroom apartment.</p><p>I’d be embarrassed to reveal the contents of my bag (let alone to millions of people on the internet) but I’m not embarrassed to say I’m well-versed in the <a rel="noreferrer noopener" href=#>best large bags</a> for daily life, work, travel and even beach vacations. If you’re in the market for a new tote that holds it all, you’re in the right place.</p><p>Table Of Contents</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading id=best-large-bags-for-work-at-a-glance>Best Large Bags for Work at a Glance</h2><p><strong>Best Overall:</strong> <a rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow" href=#>Kipling Art M Weekender</a>, $129<br><strong>Best Under $50:</strong> <a rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow" href=#>Guardung Oversized PU Leather Tote</a>, $46<br><strong>Best Boxy Tote Bag:</strong><a rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow" href=#>A New Day Large Boxy Tote Handbag</a>, $40<br><strong>Best Classic Tote:</strong> <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">Market by Monica Canvas Hero XL Tote</a>, $130<br><strong>Best Summer Bag:</strong> <a rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow" href=#>Madewell Handwoven Leather Tote</a>, $188<br><strong>Best Cool-Girl Bag:</strong> <a rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow" href=#>Clare V.

Like searching for an apartment. it’s important to shop with a personal set of criteria for <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">your ideal bag</a>. Do you want an interior pocket, a zipper top or a multi-wear strap? Leather, faux leather or maybe a canvas material? There’s not one right answer so the choice is yours! Luckily, there are plenty of options on the market that meet multiple criteria.</p><p>If you’re planning on using this bag every day for years, it may be worth investing in a higher-quality piece like the bags from <a href=# rel=nofollow>Polène</a>. If you’re looking for a grocery or <a rel="noreferrer noopener" href=#>beach tote</a> for the summer, an affordable choice from Zara will get the job done. No matter your budget, the 10 bags I’ve rounded up below are just as cute as they are spacious. Or as Tom says in Succession, ludicrously capacious.</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading id=what-to-look-for-in-a-large-bag-for-work>What to Look for in a Large Bag for Work</h2><p>What to shop for in a large bag for work depends on your personal work needs. If you need to lug your laptop to and from work every day, you might want to find a bag with a laptop sleeve or compartment. If you’re always losing your keys, using a bag that features a built-in key ring or fob will be helpful. Additionally, consider the amount of pockets you need. Keeping your credit card or Metro card in an outer pocket can make commuting and grabbing lunch way easier.</p><p>Last thing: Straps and handles. Try to make sure the straps and/or handles on the bag are durable and preferably plush or soft, so they don’t dig into your shoulders. If you need a large bag, chances are you’re carrying a lot of stuff. A lot of stuff = a heavy load. Be kind to your shoulders and back!</p><p>Our mission at STYLECASTER is to bring style to the people, and we only feature products we think you’ll love as much as we do.

It’s large enough to store your laptop, headphones, and even an extra outfit or two.

Simple Tote</p>“Clare V. was my first big splurge: I got myself a <a rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow" href=#>Simple Tote</a> (navy blue, I don’t think that colorway exists anymore) when I was promoted at work back in 2016, and I wore it non-stop for about five years. Clare V. has so many timeless, Cool Girl bag designs (the <a rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow" href=#>Moyen Messenger</a> is one I see everywhere!), but the brand’s classic Simple Tote has had my heart for a long, long time — and it’s still such a refreshing, effortless, French design. I truly think this bag will always be the It Girl of totes. You just can’t go wrong. Especially with the camel suede and stripes — it gives it a little personality, like it’s saying “I don’t take myself that seriously.”<p>I always wore my Simple Tote with the long straps, because I find short handles to be uncomfortable, but you can go either way.

I recently repurchased <a rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow" href=#>this Le Pliage tote</a> and can’t believe I ever stopped wearing mine in the first place. It holds&nbsp;so&nbsp;much and sits comfortably on my shoulders for hours. Because it’s made of nylon, it’s easier to clean (and keep clean!) — plus, you can feel safe using it for the gym, or really being rough with it, since it’s not made of a delicate material like soft leather. Parents out there will love the fact that you can throw diapers and formula in your bag and not worry about milk (and other fun baby liquids) ruining the fabric because of the water-resistant feature. It’s practical meets stylish, and everyone needs at least one bag in that category.<p><strong>Dimensions: </strong>12 ¼”W x 11 ¾”H x 7 ½”D.<br><strong>Capacity:</strong> large<br><strong>Colorways: </strong>7<br><strong>Material: </strong>Nylon<br><strong>Storage:</strong> Top zip compartment, interior zip pocket</p><p><h2 class=wp-block-heading id=pros>Pros</h2></p><ul class=is-style-pros><li>Water-resistant lining</li><li>Large capacity</li></ul><p><h2 class=wp-block-heading id=cons>Cons</h2></p><ul class=is-style-cons><li>Some reviewers note arm straps are on the shorter side</li></ul></li><li class="pmc-fallback-list-item-wrap lrv-u-margin-b-2"><h2>Market By Monica Canvas Hero XL Tote</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/stylecaster.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/04/market-tote.png><p>Market By Monica Canvas Hero XL Tote</p>Trader Joe’s mini totes may be all the rage, but a) good luck finding one, and b) they’re really not that spacious!

It’s in the same camp as Cuyana and Everlane (in our opinion), but a touch more “Quiet Luxury.” It’s decadent without screaming about it, and the price is mid-range (in terms of designer bags!). What makes it really stand out, aside from its polished form, is that it’s really built to last and look stunning every time you wear it. It comes in five neutral shades and will fit a laptop up to 14”.<p><strong>Dimensions: </strong>13” & 14” L x 10” H x 6″<br><strong>Capacity:</strong> Not listed<br><strong>Colorways:</strong> 6<br><strong>Material: </strong>Vegan ultrafiber leather<br><strong>Storage: </strong>1 large compartment, internal zip compartment, internal pockets</p><p><h2 class=wp-block-heading id=pros>Pros</h2></p><ul class=is-style-pros><li>Sleek, minimalist “quiet luxury” style</li><li>Multiple internal pockets, compartments</li></ul><p><h2 class=wp-block-heading id=cons>Cons</h2></p><ul class=is-style-cons><li>Vegan leather</li><li>Pricey</li></ul></li><li class="pmc-fallback-list-item-wrap lrv-u-margin-b-2"><h2>Sandro Kasbah Double S Bag</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/stylecaster.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/04/Screenshot-2024-04-10-at-3.36.46 PM.png><p>Sandro Kasbah Double S Bag</p><p>On Sale 40% off</p>For days when your tote bag needs to be just as cute as your outfit, <a rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow" href=#>this spacious printed Sandro bag</a> is perfect. French brand Sandro is known for its preppy clothing designs (so many peter pan collars and tweed — like a punkier Chanel, IMO), and its bags are just as whimsical.

It’s unique, has that <a rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow" href=#>Christian Dior shopper bag look</a> (but for a lot less), and it’s very roomy.

It’s just very, very functional, has the right amount of pockets, and is extremely spacious. And gorgeous. This bag is impressively pretty.<p>Other features I like: The material is water and stain-resistant, and you can easily clean it with a Wet Wipe or soap, water, and a towel. The couple times I accidentally got sunscreen all over it during vacation, I was able to easily wipe off the residue. It has magnetic closures, so you can keep your stuff secure without zipping all the time.
